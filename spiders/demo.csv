Testing dark matter physics,"Cosmic voids occupy approximately 70% of our Universe. Scarcity of baryonic matter inside voids (which means very little contamination from complex baryonic astrophysics) makes the voids pristine environments, which are ideal to test properties of dark matter and nature of gravity. This project focuses on mapping and testing dark matter within cosmic voids. The project will require investigating astroparticle physics and signatures of dark matter, as well as, using astronomical data to map the distribution of dark matter inside cosmic voids.

Conservation of plant communities in forest landscapes,"This PhD projects will survey the plant communities in Tasmania’s beautiful forests. The project will involve fieldwork in unmanaged reserves and old-growth forest, previously harvested forests and recent fire-impacted sites in a landscape ecology study. Timber harvesting and fire can have substantial impacts on native plant communities, especially for rainforest-associated species. The impacts are expected to vary between species and with disturbance type, intensity and frequency. This project will contribute to a large ARC Future Fellowship study investigating the complex trade-offs involved between biodiversity conservation and timber production. The responses to management of numerous species of plants will be linked with timber yield/revenue across contrasting management systems in a large landscape ecology study. The research aims to guide forest policy by determining the optimal mix of reserves and management to maximise plant conservation outcomes in landscapes available for timber production. Fieldwork plans will be aligned to the larger project to survey biodiversity along a disturbance/age gradient. The candidate will contribute to other aspects of project conceptualization. There may be opportunities for global collaboration to compile/analyse datasets of forestry impacts on plants; the project will involve some advanced data handling and statistical skills. This PhD project will help develop the candidate’s skills in critical thinking, project management, fieldwork, data management and analysis, writing and communication. It will prepare the student for future careers in research, or with government or non-government land management or conservation agencies.

Conservation genetics of WT eagles,"The Tasmanian population of the wedge-tailed eagle is of conservation concern. Previous conservation genetic studies of this population have been hampered by a low number of polymorphic molecular markers. This project will use next-generation DNA sequencing approaches to genotype existing tissue samples (>200) to yield thousands of polymorphic molecular markers. These markers will then be used to estimate the effective population size (Ne) of this species, and to contrast this against census size estimates generated by a concurrent citizen science project. The genetic markers will also be used to investigate dispersal and residency across fine and broad spatial scales, complementing simultaneous research involving GPS-tracked eagles. Finally, assay techniques will be developed for a subset of markers such that they can be applied to degraded DNA samples representing eagle mortalities or shed feathers, addressing questions regarding the genetic provenance and parentage of individuals.

Understanding the role of police in regional Australia,"Too often we assume to know what police do; yet, to date, there has been no Australian research undertaken to map exactly what police do in their everyday duties. While Tasmania Police officers are compelled by the Tasmanian Government to undertake the core tasks of criminal investigation, public order maintenance, emergency management, and traffic policing, anecdotal evidence suggests that they do much more, and many of these non-core duties may be more appropriately assigned to other frontline services. These secondary tasks are often undertaken by police with limited training and resourcing, and with limited consideration of the vicarious trauma and mental fatigue associated with this work. In this collaborative project between the Tasmanian Institute of Law Enforcement Studies, The Police Association of Tasmania, and Tasmania Police, candidates will work closely with frontline police to map their duties, investigate the wellbeing of officers, and to consider what, if any, solutions can be offered to redirect tasks that are better addressed by community organisations, businesses, and other public servants.

Building resilient tourism regions through technology,"COVID-19 has had profound impacts upon the tourism industry. While some regions are suffering, others are flourishing as tourists disperse in different ways and react to COVID-19 lockdowns, border closures and outbreaks. As a result, debate has emerged over what a sustainable tourism future should look like, as well as where and how tourists should travel through Tasmania. Technology offers a means to mitigate these debates.  When used ethically it can assist in understanding where and how tourist travel, it can enhance experiences in destinations, and it can encourage behaviour change. Ultimately it has the ability to build more resilient tourism regions. This project seeks to build upon the highly successful Tourism Tracer project and use technology as a means through which the visitor experience can be augmented, regional dispersal can be monitored, and behaviour change can be encouraged to enhance more sustainable outcomes in regional Tasmania. We are seeking students with a passion for tourism who can assess, design, evaluate or augment the Tourism Tracer technology, which is a sensor based technology that includes use location based tracking, surveys and real time data visualisations.

Reducing harm from novel psychoactives,"Over the past decade there has been an explosion of entirely new substances released into the recreational drug market, coined “Novel Psychoactive Substances” (NPS). Most of these have had no human safety testing; some have been embraced by consumers (e.g. mephedrone), many have been short-lived, some have had devastating consequences (e.g. deaths from potent fentanyl analogues). This project aims to 1. Develop new consumer focused tools to understand both the desirable and undesirable effects of particular substances, with an aim of predicting which substances will expand in use and which will ‘fail fast’, which is helpful for focussing drug market monitoring and early warning health systems; 2.

International colleagues have been focussing on the areas that clinicians feel are most important for cognitive rehabilitation as part of substance use disorder treatment. As part of this project, we want to focus on identifying the practical day-to-day issues that people seeking substance use disorder treatment feel are causing them the most challenges. We also want to review the literature to identify the particular types of cognitive deficits that have the strongest associations with poor outcomes and the way that these interact with particular types of treatment (for example, where medications are used rather than psychological interventions, is there a smaller association between a particular aspect of cognition and outcome?), and which are the most modifiable risk factors. Depending on your particular interests, you may then work with our programmer to develop a novel way of assessing the key aspects of cognition identified in the earlier parts of the study or work with our colleagues involved in substance use treatment to devise and test practical strategies for treatment providers to adapt their interventions for clients with particular deficits in cognition.

The Hubble Constant Tension,"The Hubble Constant Tension is currently one of the most discussed problems in modern cosmology [Freedman, Nature Astronomy, 1, 0121, (2017)]. The Hubble constant is a parameter that describes the rate of change of the expansion of our universe. Measurements of the Hubble constant based on local observations [Riess, et al. Astrophysical Journal, 826, 56 (2016)] are in tension with the measurements based on Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation [Planck Collaboration, Astronomy & Astrophysics, 594, A13, (2016)]. The CMB was emitted when the Universe was very young, whereas the local observations are sensitive to the late epochs of the universe. Possible solutions of this tension range for the scenarios relevant to the early universe [Poulin, et al. Physical Review Letters, 122, 221301 (2019)], or local universe [Desmond, et al.

Precision astrometry for spacecraft tracking,"Traditionally the tracking of interplanetary spacecraft is undertaken with large aperture antennas such as those operated by the NASA Deep Space Network. Tracking with this type of instrument has limited angular resolution and this corresponds to increasingly worse linear resolution as the distance of the spacecraft from the Earth increases.  Precision tracking of both interplanetary and orbiting spacecraft has a wide range of scientific and practical applications, from measurement of gravitational fields for distant objects to precise orbit determination for geospatial positional and science applications.  We have recently developed a new astrometric calibration method for very long baseline interferometry known as multiview.  This method is able to measure relative astrometry in a single epoch with a precision of 10-20 microarcseconds.  This project will apply this new technique for spacecraft tracking and determine the impact of the frequency dependence of the core emission from active galactic nuclei on ultra-high precision astronomy both for spacecraft tracking and broader astrophysical and geodetic applications.

Co-designed frailty indicators,"Frailty screening and assessment tools use similar classification or scoring systems that require either self-reported, deficit scoring or health practitioner clinical judgement on the degree of frailty. This then may be used to infer care delivery or end of life decision making. Frailty scores can assist to identify older people at high risk who can then receive targeted interventions to delay admission to residential aged care (Khadka et al. 2020). There is a paucity of research focussed on frailty in aged care facilities despite the high population of frail older people. The input that the client/patient or family/caregiver has in terms of determining the frailty score and then, at what point care is escalated or deescalated is unknown. The use of personalised frailty tools in older persons care organisations is unclear, and the co-contribution that caregivers including family members has into the design and use of such tools is not known. A co-designed project is anticipated to address the care planning for individuals at risk of the consequences of frailty.

Paramedics and emergency dental care,"There is a scarcity of data regarding traumatic dental injuries (TDI) and isolated dental injuries (IDI) worldwide, including their presentation in hospitals across Australia. Less is known about the emergency response of paramedic services and the role and competency of paramedics in both initial treatment and referral to specialist pathways. With national increases in preventable dental hospitalisation, this Project, offers the opportunity to work with leading scholars in Public Health and Paramedicine to evaluate the interdisciplinary response of health services to dental injuries in the community accessing data from current services in Tasmania. The research will also determine the detail of education and practice in paramedic programs of dental emergency management. This provides the opportunity to explore the development of professional competencies specific skills in other fields. Professionals must recognise their role in treating oral injuries and preventing compounding conditions. Overall this Project offers the opportunity to improve dental health outcomes and potential collaborative relationships between paramedic and primary care providers in Australian communities.

Optogenetic and sonogenetic with TRPA1,"The project is part of the funded (and extended) ARC fellowship (2016-2022) aimed to develop a novel optogenetic and sonogenetic approach to manipulate neuronal membrane excitability. Our laboratory has previously developed novel channelrhodopsin mutants to manipulate neuronal membrane excitability but channelrhodopsins suffer from low conductance and lack spectral separation. Using photosensitising fluorescent proteins or fluorescent dyes and the mammalian membrane channel that can be activated by reactive oxygen species, we have established that it is possible to use light to control membrane excitability with better spectral separation and high efficiency. The project will aim to further validate and characterise the approach, develop ways to deliver the tools using recombinant virus and test whether the approach can be modified to become a multi-modal neuromodulatory approach to control neuronal excitability with ultrasound. This project will develop important and novel tools for general neuroscientific research that address the current shortcomings and limitations of current tools and contribute to the tools available to the international neuroscientific research communities.

3-D food printing,"This project is to research factors that govern the quality of products that can be produced by 3D food printing for valorisation of food grade seconds and wastes. Regionally, lower grade food products such as mechanically recovered meats and second grade fruit and vegetables could be stabilised into feed streams for future food printing or other restructuring technologies. However, high-throughput commercial applications of 3D food printing will require feed streams that are stabilised and optimised for producing quality printed foods. Formulation, combined with food preservation systems, such as microwave assisted thermal sterilisation (MATS) or flow-through UHT will be required to make shelf-stable bulk food ingredients for 3D-food printing production lines.
This project will characterise the critical variables for stabilising the texture, colour and flavour of products such as animal proteins and fruit and vegetable powders or purees for use as shelf-stable solutions to feed 3D food printers. The research will investigate the performance of gelation and stabilisation options and test the quality of outcomes using 3D-food printers. Research will use a texture analyser, headspace GC-MS aroma measurement and electronic togue to characterise the outcomes of formulation and processing variables required for stabilization and successful 3D printing into consumer desirable food formats. Graduates from this research will be skilled in the creation of new food products for a career in advanced food product development.

Processing and analysing Enose data,"This PhD project is about processing and analysing data from TIAs current soil sensor (Enose) investigations.  The wider Enose project is based on a low-cost electronic nose, which is designed to detect soil volatile compounds, for use as a proxy of soil condition. We have high-level evidence that the signals produced by this device change under differing soil conditions and various mixes of known organisms. In addition, there is evidence the eNose can detect volatiles that are related to soil biological activity and function.
The processing objectives of the PhD project are to develop the data analysis and visualisation tools required to transform the raw eNose data into usable output (for both farmers and researchers).
The analysis objectives of the PhD project are to determine the 
The data generated by the eNose is unlike any existing soil data.  The eNose signals are arrays of high-frequency time-series measurements, which correspond to both lower-frequency time-series data sets (e.g. weather and farmer interventions), and cross-sectional background and scientific knowledge (e.g. soil classifications and traditional microbiological analysis).  Analysing and modelling this unique form of ‘big data’, in both cross-sectional and time-series dimensions, will require innovative methodologies – drawing from the fields of statistics, econometrics, AI and machine-learning.  In other words, this PhD project is about using data science within applied agricultural research.
Ultimately, the eNose signals need to be incorporated into predictive and explanatory models for soil condition metrics.  The PhD project will focus on models of “soil resilience” currently under development in a project funded by the Soil CRC.   Models will

Stomatal functions in crop tolerance to combined abiotic stresses,"Increased instability of climate leads to more frequent extreme abiotic stresses, such as heatwaves, waterlogging, drought and salinity (caused by soil water content decrease), threatening crop yield and grain quality. Besides, these environmental stresses happen simultaneously, such as heatwave with drought, drought with salinity, waterlogging with salinity under natural conditions. It is necessary to study whether there is a ‘common’ stress tolerance mechanism/signalling employed by crops regarding combined abiotic stress at a time, which not only saves crop energy budget but also increases efficiency in defending stresses. It is well documented that stomatal activity presents a high linkage with crop tolerance to salinity, drought, and heat. However, only limited studies have been reported to compare stomatal morphology changes or electrophysiological changes due to the scarcity of plant materials that are highly resistant to a few abiotic stresses at a time.  The proposed host lab for this project has privileges of using elite wheat and barley varieties as being a traditional institute for crop pre-breeding and breeding.
Stomatal guard cells control both water and carbon cycles of plants. As the main water and gas exchange ‘gates’, a fast stomatal activity in response to abiotic stress determines crop survival, development, grain quality and yield under water determined situations. Identifying the broad-spectrum mechanisms of salinity, drought and even heat induced signals and their regulation over stomata is critical to efficiently manipulate crops to breed elite crop varieties for pleiotropic tolerance. Key questions on stomatal molecular mechanisms, physiological and morphological changes will be addressed in this project:

Smart-Farm data for dairy cows,"The “transition period” for dairy cows is from late pregnancy, to early lactation and subsequent mating.  This study is based on data measured with modern dairy technology (such as MooMonitors, nutritional intakes and precise milking records) to improve management processes related to cow health and production during the vulnerable transition and early lactation periods. The broad goals of the research are to improve cow health, fertility and productivity, and reduce culling, which in turn appeals to society’s expectations of cow welfare and may reduce greenhouse gas emissions per litre of milk produced.
In the first two years of this project, behaviour, reproduction, culling and productivity records obtained from previous years at TIA Dairy Research Facility will be used to (1) model the date of calving more than two weeks prior to the event and (2) provide baseline records of normal and abnormal behaviour changes after calving. Early indicators of compromised health or poor productivity will be identified and correlated with factors that could potentially be used as management interventions.
In the second and third years of the project, new data will be collected to study various transition management regimes (e.g. nutritional management via alternative forages) and their effects on cow health and productivity in the subsequent lactations.

Assessing success in student housing,"This project studies user experiences and perceptions of student (apartment) accommodation spaces at the University of Tasmania and how successfully these designs sit within the broader university and urban environments. It aims to contribute knowledge from and for Tasmania on the experience of house and home for students living in university accommodations, as well as design insights for future accommodation developments. The Northern and Southern Transformation Projects at the University of Tasmania provide a unique opportunity to study occupant outcomes in various accommodation configurations as various existing units are upgraded and new ones are brought online.
Student apartment housing is a relatively under examined topic, especially in Australia. Using post occupancy evaluation techniques, this research will examine student accommodation cases at UTAS, to assemble robust research that supports quality in future designs of university housing in Tasmania and throughout Australia.
In addition to adding to the literature on occupant perceptions of house and home, this project has the potential to play a vital role in contributing to designs of future student accommodation, as more housing options are yet to be designed and completed on the UTAS campuses. Robust, design-focused findings, clearly communicated, could thus contribute to more vibrant and inclusive campus and urban environments in the future.

"Pink rot of potato, a reemerging problem","Pink rot is an important, but understudied global potato disease. In recent years pink rot has re-emerged as one of the most critical impediments to the Australian potato processing industry. Approximately 10% of the current seasons crop is estimated to have been lost to this soilborne fungal pathogen which causes infection late in the season both in-field and in storage. Recent epidemics have been promoted by conducive environmental conditions and the decreasing effectiveness of key fungicides. Epidemics can occur quickly and rapidly but knowledge surrounding what triggers sustained pathogen growth and infection is poorly understood. Certain soil environmental parameters are thought to impact pathogen success. There are also intriguing linkages between occurrence of pink rot and other important potato soil borne disease.
There are major knowledge gaps in our understanding of the epidemiology of this disease; what role do alternative hosts play in pathogen survival? How does the soil environment drive pathogen proliferation and infection events? What are the mechanisms of interaction with other important soil-borne pathogens? How can we use this knowledge to develop novel, sustainable controls?
This PhD will work within a dedicated potato pathology research team in close collaboration with major international industry partners to seek answers to some of these critical questions and identify novel disease solutions.

Preservation mechanisms for space foods,"Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilisation (MATS) is a new technology to enable the production of high-quality shelf stable foods for added value exports.  While commercial retail products typically need 1 year of shelf life, foods for Defence need a 2- year shelf life and projected space applications like the “Moon to Mars” missions need a 5-year shelf life in the presence of ionizing space radiation.  Flavour and related nutrient degradation, however, occurs over time due to oxygen radical and ionizing radiation catalysed damage, and chemical changes such as Maillard reactions due to carbohydrate content. This research project will look at  new ways to counter the reactions to maintain good flavour, colour and nutrient profiles in processed foods under the extreme storage conditions that may be encountered in exports to tropical countries or specialised foods for long shelf-life space and defence applications. The research will examine the shelf life of novel antioxidant combinations to determine and model the changes in food quality over extended/accelerated shelf-life assessment systems set up with Defence Science and Technology, Scottsdale  and space radiation simulation with ANSTO using an external ion beam.  The efficacy of hydrogen to quench high energy radicals and natural polyphenols to trap reactive intermediates of the Maillard reaction will be assessed for changes in colour by photometry, changes in volatile compositions by GC-MS, changes in taste by electronic tongue, changes in vitamin content by biochemical assay. Experimental design will apply response surface methodology to map the impacts of storage variables time, temperature and humidity on product shelf life deriving predictive models with Q10-values using the Arrhenius equation. Results will be applied to the development of technology to make extreme shelf-life foods to enable applications in space and extended food storage in hot environment.

Optimal sorghum varieties for Baijiu,"Australian sorghum’s five-year-average export worth is $286.6 million (GRDC, 2018). The profitability of the malting sorghum market is based on yield and quality. ‘Adequate’ to ‘high’ yields ensures sorghum cropping sustainability by reducing growers risks if the Sorghum is sold as feed and maximizes profits if sold as malting sorghum. However, without suitable malt quality characteristics growers and the beyond-farm-gate value chain can’t reliably achieve the malting sorghum premium.
Baijiu is a liquor produced from Sorghum in China, Korea and Japan (Hong et al., 2020).

Management of sucking bugs in Rubus,"The Australian Rubus berry industry is in the midst of a rapid expansion. These gains have been derived in part by the increased utilisation of covered cropping systems. However, these systems coupled with reductions in agrochemical use have created ideal environments for pestiferous insects including sucking bugs such as mirids and pentatomids. Further, due to consumer driven expectations, a return to chemically intensive berry production methodologies is no longer seen by industry as an acceptable method of sucking bug control. This project seeks to advance Australian integrated pest management (IPM) of sucking bugs in blackberries and raspberries by assessing the efficacy of potential IPM controls for these pests. In order to provide improved pest monitoring strategies, this project will also investigate the use of, and where relevant isolate and field test, the pheromone cues used by sucking bugs for pest control or crop monitoring activities in commercial Rubus production systems.

Understanding the role of police in regional Australia,"Too often we assume to know what police do; yet, to date, there has been no Australian research undertaken to map exactly what police do in their everyday duties. While Tasmania Police officers are compelled by the Tasmanian Government to undertake the core tasks of criminal investigation, public order maintenance, emergency management, and traffic policing, anecdotal evidence suggests that they do much more, and many of these non-core duties may be more appropriately assigned to other frontline services. These secondary tasks are often undertaken by police with limited training and resourcing, and with limited consideration of the vicarious trauma and mental fatigue associated with this work. In this collaborative project between the Tasmanian Institute of Law Enforcement Studies, The Police Association of Tasmania, and Tasmania Police, candidates will work closely with frontline police to map their duties, investigate the wellbeing of officers, and to consider what, if any, solutions can be offered to redirect tasks that are better addressed by community organisations, businesses, and other public servants.

The History of Forensic Science,"Forensic science includes various disciplines such as fingerprint and DNA analyses that have developed within specific socio-historical contexts. Forensic studies, as an emerging field, is the critical examination of forensic science as an object of study, usually through the lens of social science. Although a great deal of research has examined recent scandals in the use of forensic science, limited research has traced the development of forensic science within the social, political, and cultural contexts of Australia.
This project aims to document and analyse the development of forensic disciplines and their use in Tasmania in colonial through to more recent serious criminal cases (i.e., murder, attempted murder, armed robberies and rape). The project asks questions like: What counted as forensic science in police investigations and the court room? How did various types of forensic science (e.g., toxicology or fingerprint analysis) gain acceptance and achieve expert status in Tasmania? How did forensic science develop in Tasmania in comparison to other jurisdictions within Australia and beyond? What aspects of development of forensic science are unique to Tasmania? What landmark cases in Tasmania have impacted justice for victims, offenders, and the Tasmanian public?
You will explore one or more of these questions and undertake archival research in Tasmania. As part of this project, you will develop more specific research questions with your supervisors and the project design will be based on your areas of interest, knowledge and skills.

Mothering in homelessness,"Homelessness at any life stage is traumatic and increases vulnerability to poor health and mental health and violent victimisation.  Homelessness for pregnant mothers and for mothers who may or may not have custody of their children presents unique stressors.  Not only do mothers need to negotiate the risks of homelessness, they must also negotiate the potential risk of childlessness which stems from the threat that they may not be considered by the State as a suitable parent able to provide adequate care and housing for children in their custody or children with whom they hope to be reunified.
This PhD project opens scope to consider solutions to the complex issues faced by mothers who need to urgently find safe, secure housing in order to mother in ways both they and the State prioritise as safe, appropriate and meaningful.  That access to safe, affordable housing could determine mothers' access to their own children is a long-standing complex social, political, moral and practical conundrum that foregrounds the life-changing impacts of poverty, a lack of affordable housing, and contemporary child removal and family reunification practices.  It also highlights the need for rapid cross-agency collaboration to ensure humane and cost-effective responses to mothers experiencing acute vulnerability.
With scope for cross-disciplinary research, the project will engage the successful candidate in rich theoretical material addressing neoliberal motherhood, maternal surveillance, maternal identity and the lived realities of pregnancy and parenting in poverty, including in contexts of reunification.  This is a place-based project which will also aim to have local impact on the provision of specialist housing support and child protection services in Tasmania.
The overarching emphasis of the project is to draw together new empirical evidence and theoretical analysis to justify and inform policy and practice options which result in Tasmanian mothers and their children being supported to realise their right to remain together.  This is a project which will require astute attention to ethical, culturally safe, and trauma-informed research practice.

Plastic Pollution Governance in Antarctica,"This PhD project examines the plastic pollution problem in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean regions, the current governance measures for dealing with plastic pollution through the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), and other broader global governance arrangements.
The candidate will investigate the effectiveness of the global governance systems in place that address plastic pollution. Further, they will analyse activities in the region such as tourism, research and fishing and their impact on the plastic pollution problem. The candidate will undertake empirical and qualitative research to assess whether the ATS can provide an adequate governance framework to address this issue.

Intimate partner violence and children,"Currently in Australia there is a turn to recognising children and young people's unique experiences of family and domestic violence.  This includes more adequately exploring the significant engagement of children and young people in managing the direct and collateral impacts of intimate partner violence perpetrated between their caregivers.
One impact requiring further exploration is the role of caregiver intimate partner violence in children and young people's trajectories into homelessness.  In a context in which domestic violence narratives and services focus on women escaping violence with their children, unaccompanied child and youth homelessness as a potential outcome of caregiver intimate partner violence remains under-explored.
It is also the case that intimate partner violence as a characteristic of children and young people's subsequent experiences of homelessness remains under-researched.  Indeed, children and young people's own experiences as both victims and perpetrators of violence in their own intimate relationships are rarely visible.
Better understanding of the ongoing cumulative costs and risks of intimate partner violence in the lives of unaccompanied homeless children and young people is crucial to building the case for early intervention and also for understanding the kinds of support needs these cohorts may be likely to have.  In particular, there is scope to consider the role of domestic and family violence sector in strengthening responses to children and young people who at risk of experiencing unaccompanied homelessness or who are already homeless and alone.
This is a project for which innovative life story methods may be useful in eliciting deeper understanding of the intergenerational transmission of intimate partner violence.  The project presents opportunities for interdisciplinary research and conceptual and methodological work on the social value of children and young people's voices and experiences. Focused on the experiential, policy and service provision landscape in Tasmania, this project will involve the development of policy and practice models aimed at early intervention into cycles of homelessness and intimate partner violence. This is a project which will require astute attention to ethical, culturally safe, and trauma-informed research practice.

Literacy as a pathway to resilience and desistence,"Literacy is often discussed in terms of educational achievement. This project departs from this, and unpacks literacy as a social determinant of public health, examining how low functioning literacy impacts on deliquency and criminal pathways. With new reports that a significant portion of the Australian prison population does not know how to read to a level above year 5, this project considers the need to shift our understanding of literacy from part of education criteria to a more fundamental social determinant of health and wellbeing.

Homeless children and out-of-home care,"Child safety systems across Australia are struggling with increasing caseloads and ever-mounting pressure on the out-of-home care system.  Similarly, numbers of children presenting alone to Specialist Homelessness Services are increasing.  Homelessness services are also regularly providing care for children formally ordered into out-of-home care though they may be neither designed nor funded to provide the level of care children need.
This project investigates the interface of child safety and youth homelessness services for those not placed on care and protection orders.  It addresses the question of why it is that some children remain homeless for long periods of time, without an out-of-home care response.  What experiences of the child protection system do unaccompanied homeless children have, if any?  What do professionals within youth homelessness and outreach services observe about this cohort's Child Safety interactions?  What do professionals within Child Safety, youth homelessness and outreach services observe about this cohort's Child Safety interactions, including any barriers to being placed on care and protection orders or into out-of-home care?
Given the older age of children accessing youth homelessness and outreach services, this project has a particular interest in investigating responses to adolescents within child protection services.  Crossing multiple fields including the sociology of children and youth, child protection studies and welfare politics, policy and practice, this project offers interdisciplinary scope to explore issues such as the residualisation of child welfare, perceptions and assessment of the safety and risk of adolescents, and barriers to agency and service coordination for older children with complex needs.
A focus of this project is establishing what works in successful care provision for unaccompanied older children, and considering how this can be delivered in the Australian context to children based on their needs, regardless of the application of care and protection orders.  This may also include exploration of a legal framework for care provision.  This is a project which will require astute attention to ethical, culturally safe, and trauma-informed research practice.

"Health literacy, resilience & desistence","Australia has been harshly criticised for its rising incarceration and remand rates (Productivity Commission, 2021; Justice Reform Initiative, 2020). At the same time the Tasmanian government decided to reimagine the youth detention centre in the North of the state, which warrants us to consider desistence mechanisms for youth at risk of engaging in delinquent behaviours.
A link between low literacy and incarceration in Australia was established in the 1980s, and research has found that 60% of adults and 85% of children in detention in Australia have 'low functionality literacy'. Numbers in Tasmania are likely to be higher, given that 48% of the general Tasmanian population have low functional literacy. A bidirectional relationship exists between Health Literacy (HL) and educational attainment (Cummings & Obel-Omia, 2016; Pérez-Rodrigo et al., 2001). And whilst education is an important social determinant, HL ('the personal characteristics and social resources needed for individuals and communities to access, understand, appraise and use information and services to make decisions about health. Health literacy includes the capacity to communicate, assert and enact these decisions', Dodson et al. 2015) has been defined as a social determinant in its own right (Bröder et al., 2018). There is growing evidence that health literacy can be a significant factor in desistance from crime, and can redress inequities that exist in health and society (Batterham et al., 2014; Hadden et al., 2018; Paakkari & George, 2018).
Using the Ophelia principles (Batterham et al. 2014) and HealthLit4Kids as a program platform, this project seeks to develop and test an early intervention program for young people at risk of experiencing youth justice. The program will be designed to ensure disengaged youth acquire the skills necessary for desistence and resilience. This project aims at furthering the goals for all Tasmanians to live 'good healthy lives'.

"Evidence-based, intelligence-led, and knowledge-based policing: Identifying better practices for creating public safety and preparing police for complexity","While policing may appear unchanged in the modern era, over the last 50 years policing has been transformed by a range of strategies aimed at preventing crime and facilitating crime control. Starting with the innovations of community policing in the 1960s, policing organisations in western democracies have sought to change the relationships between policing organisations and the communities they serve as a means to reduce crime. Yet, other more recent innovations in policing, such as problem-oriented and intelligence-led approaches, have in some cases damaged the trust in police and deepened existing inequalities.
In this project, you will work with leading policing scholars and pracademics to identify, evaluate, and create new policing practices that can better address the “wicked problems” of public safety. The focus of this project is on how evidence, intelligence, and/or knowledge can be used to address major public safety issues, such as how to prepare police for the complexity of managing global events (pandemics and climate change), eliminating gendered violence, diverting vulnerable people away from the criminal justice system, reducing recidivist violence, and the role of police professionalisation on police capability and preparedness for this complexity.

Culturally Responsive Health Care,"Australian health professions increasingly expect practitioners to be culturally safe and responsive in their health care practice. In research and education efforts on this topic, there is often an emphasis on health professionals from dominant groups learning to interact with 'diverse' patient populations.

It will explore how the specificity of context, place and the intersectional identities of health professionals and patients are active in creating culturally safe health care environments. This project will contribute scholarly knowledge which can inform curriculum and teaching practice, and health profession practice.

Disability in criminal justice,"Interactions with the criminal justice system are often stressful, and this stress can be compounded when a person has a disability that may affect their capacity to self-advocate for their rights and to be aware of the potential consequences of such interactions.  For example, the caution about detainee rights given by police is complex in meaning and often delivered at rapid pace in difficult circumstances.  A person with a disability that affects comprehension may agree to be questioned under caution without fully understanding the consequences, resulting in an erosion of their rights.  Given the over-representation of people with disability in correctional facilities (which is over 80%), investigation into how people can be better supported in interactions with police and the wider criminal justice system is warranted.
This project will explore the experiences of people with an intellectual or cognitive disability at various stages of the policing process, and assess the suitability of that process to uphold the rights of people with disability to make informed decisions.  The project will aim to develop and test possible alternatives to complex policing processes (such as the police caution), and consider what, if any, additional support is required to raise rights awareness, including the right to self-advocacy.

Building resilient tourism regions through technology,"COVID-19 has had profound impacts upon the tourism industry. While some regions are suffering, others are flourishing as tourists disperse in different ways and react to COVID-19 lockdowns, border closures and outbreaks. As a result, debate has emerged over what a sustainable tourism future should look like, as well as where and how tourists should travel through Tasmania. Technology offers a means to mitigate these debates.  When used ethically it can assist in understanding where and how tourist travel, it can enhance experiences in destinations, and it can encourage behaviour change. Ultimately it has the ability to build more resilient tourism regions. This project seeks to build upon the highly successful Tourism Tracer project and use technology as a means through which the visitor experience can be augmented, regional dispersal can be monitored, and behaviour change can be encouraged to enhance more sustainable outcomes in regional Tasmania. We are seeking students with a passion for tourism who can assess, design, evaluate or augment the Tourism Tracer technology, which is a sensor based technology that includes use location based tracking, surveys and real time data visualisations.

Barriers in Police Use of the Translating and Interpreting Service,"Australia is, fundamentally, a multicultural country. However, multiculturalism in policing is a long-term, yet to be fully met goal, with police organisations  constantly striving to communicate better, and reach out more to multicultural groups. It has however been reported that police officers rarely reach out to translation services, either face to face, over the phone, or online. There are multiple reasons for this, but they have never been fully explored.

Reducing harm from novel psychoactives,"Over the past decade there has been an explosion of entirely new substances released into the recreational drug market, coined “Novel Psychoactive Substances” (NPS). Most of these have had no human safety testing; some have been embraced by consumers (e.g. mephedrone), many have been short-lived, some have had devastating consequences (e.g. deaths from potent fentanyl analogues). This project aims to 1. Develop new consumer focused tools to understand both the desirable and undesirable effects of particular substances, with an aim of predicting which substances will expand in use and which will ‘fail fast’, which is helpful for focussing drug market monitoring and early warning health systems; 2. Develop databases and resources for consumers and health agencies that profile subjective effects of NPS and provide health evidence and harm reduction advice.

Making drug treatment cognition-informed,"It has been estimated in 2018 that over 2% of the global population experienced a substance use disorder. Treatment outcomes for substance use disorder are not excellent, with a relapse rate between 40-60%. Increasingly there is an awareness that cognitive functioning is a key contributor to treatment outcomes – whereby poorer levels of particular aspects of cognition are predictors of less response to treatment, earlier dropout and increased rates of relapse.
Our group have been focussing on this area for some time. We have developed and tested novel, gamified cognitive tasks that assess specific aspects of cognition and are making these open source for health workers to access. International colleagues have been focussing on the areas that clinicians feel are most important for cognitive rehabilitation as part of substance use disorder treatment. As part of this project, we want to focus on identifying the practical day-to-day issues that people seeking substance use disorder treatment feel are causing them the most challenges. We also want to review the literature to identify the particular types of cognitive deficits that have the strongest associations with poor outcomes and the way that these interact with particular types of treatment (for example, where medications are used rather than psychological interventions, is there a smaller association between a particular aspect of cognition and outcome?), and which are the most modifiable risk factors. Depending on your particular interests, you may then work with our programmer to develop a novel way of assessing the key aspects of cognition identified in the earlier parts of the study or work with our colleagues involved in substance use treatment to devise and test practical strategies for treatment providers to adapt their interventions for clients with particular deficits in cognition.

Digital communication and literacy,"Tasmania has literacy rates among the lowest in the country (ABS, 2012). Being functionally illiterate has a negative impact at school, on employment choice, and often on psychological wellbeing (e.g., Forrest et al., 2018). At the same time, our reliance on written language for our interactions has never been higher. Young people are constantly consuming and creating digital information, often in the form of written words.
The proposed project aims to a) examine the language styles that Tasmanian high school and university students use in their digital messages, and b) assess whether and how these styles relate to their traditional literacy skills. These questions come a decade after the outpouring of concern that teenagers, exposed to such ""textisms"" as ""gr8, c u @ skool!!!"", would lose their ability to read and write conventionally. This fear was debunked (for a review, see Wood, Kemp, & Plester, 2014), when it was shown that young people who used more of these linguistically creative textisms had better literacy skills than their peers.
Today, digital writing instead tends to omit grammatical markers (capitalisation, punctuation,) and to incorporate emojis and extraaaaaa letters. It is time to re-assess: the project would replicate and extend the research designs of a decade ago, to assess whether these changes in writing style have led to reductions in young people's writing quality and ability. The findings would help create short, practical modules for young people to improve their ability to tailor their writing to the situation, with implications for social and vocational success.

The Hubble Constant Tension,"The Hubble Constant Tension is currently one of the most discussed problems in modern cosmology [Freedman, Nature Astronomy, 1, 0121, (2017)]. The Hubble constant is a parameter that describes the rate of change of the expansion of our universe. Measurements of the Hubble constant based on local observations [Riess, et al. Astrophysical Journal, 826, 56 (2016)] are in tension with the measurements based on Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation [Planck Collaboration, Astronomy & Astrophysics, 594, A13, (2016)]. The CMB was emitted when the Universe was very young, whereas the local observations are sensitive to the late epochs of the universe. Possible solutions of this tension range for the scenarios relevant to the early universe [Poulin, et al. Physical Review Letters, 122, 221301 (2019)], or local universe [Desmond, et al.

The lifecycle of supermassive black hole jets,"Supermassive black holes residing at galaxy centres are responsible for the most energetic phenomena in the Universe. Known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), these objects launch relativistic magnetohydrodynamic jets which accelerate particles to energies several orders of magnitude higher than those achievable at the Large Hadron Collider. Energy input from AGN jets has fundamentally re-shaped the cosmic history of the Universe, by regulating the heating-cooling cycles of intergalactic gas – the material used to build up stars and planets.
Despite their importance, much remains unknown about the physics of these objects. Fortunately, their synchrotron emission is observable with radio telescopes. In the 2020s, observations with Square Kilometre Array (SKA) pathfinder telescopes will increase the number of known AGN jets more than ten-fold. However, the mapping between physical and observable jet properties is highly non-linear. A major outstanding challenge will therefore be in interpreting these observations.
This project will use the Radio AGN in Semi-Analytic Environments (RAiSE) model to address this issue. Developed at UTAS over the past decade, RAiSE is arguably the most realistic and successful analytical model internationally, accurately describing the dynamical evolution, feedback and radio emission from AGN jets. RAiSE is therefore the ideal tool for interpreting huge (>10 million objects) samples from SKA pathfinders, a task well beyond the more detailed hydrodynamic simulations due to their computational cost. The successful candidate will develop a new generation of the RAiSE model, incorporating the complex interplay between radio jet and lobe dynamics, and the jets’ interaction with the surrounding gas. Calibrated RAiSE models will be applied to next generation surveys from Australian and international SKA pathfinders, and constrain the duty cycle of jet activity and feedback.

Testing dark matter physics,"Cosmic voids occupy approximately 70% of our Universe. Scarcity of baryonic matter inside voids (which means very little contamination from complex baryonic astrophysics) makes the voids pristine environments, which are ideal to test properties of dark matter and nature of gravity.

The project will require investigating astroparticle physics and signatures of dark matter, as well as, using astronomical data to map the distribution of dark matter inside cosmic voids.

Precision astrometry for spacecraft tracking,"Traditionally the tracking of interplanetary spacecraft is undertaken with large aperture antennas such as those operated by the NASA Deep Space Network. Tracking with this type of instrument has limited angular resolution and this corresponds to increasingly worse linear resolution as the distance of the spacecraft from the Earth increases.  Precision tracking of both interplanetary and orbiting spacecraft has a wide range of scientific and practical applications, from measurement of gravitational fields for distant objects to precise orbit determination for geospatial positional and science applications.  We have recently developed a new astrometric calibration method for very long baseline interferometry known as multiview.  This method is able to measure relative astrometry in a single epoch with a precision of 10-20 microarcseconds.  This project will apply this new technique for spacecraft tracking and determine the impact of the frequency dependence of the core emission from active galactic nuclei on ultra-high precision astronomy both for spacecraft tracking and broader astrophysical and geodetic applications.

Magnetohydrodynamic simulations of supermassive black hole jets,"Accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies releases the most energetic outbursts in the Universe. Resultant jets of synchrotron-emitting plasma, visible to radio telescopes, burrow through the surrounding gas. This gas is the raw fuel from which stars are made, and by imparting some of their energy to it the black hole jets are known to regulate the star formation history of the most massive galaxies.
Much is unknown about the processes responsible for triggering and propagation of black hole jets. On the other hand, current and upcoming surveys with leading international telescopes (Square Kilometre Array pathfinder instruments, including ASKAP and MWA in Australia – and eventually the SKA itself) will study these objects in unprecedented detail across a wide range of radio frequencies. The aim of this project is to construct an equally sophisticated theoretical framework to interpret these data.
This project will use highly parallel High Performance Computing (HPC) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations of relativistic jets, together with a state-of-the-art model for calculating the resultant synchrotron emission, to predict detailed radio synchrotron emission and polarization signatures of these jets throughout their lifecycle. Comparison of simulation predictions with data from SKA pathfinders will constrain the mechanisms responsible for the onset and cessation of jet activity, and help to guide development of future observing strategies.
This project will be performed in collaboration with colleagues from the University of Hertfordshire, International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR), CSIRO, and the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON).

Feedback from black hole jets,"Accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies releases the most energetic outbursts in the Universe. Resultant jets of synchrotron-emitting plasma, visible to radio telescopes, burrow through the surrounding gas. This gas is the raw fuel from which stars are made, and by imparting some of their energy to it the black hole jets are known to regulate the star formation history of the most massive galaxies.
Despite being a crucial ingredient in the galaxy formation paradigm, mechanisms through which jets regulate galaxy growth are still under debate. This project will use highly parallel High Performance Computing (HPC) hydrodynamic numerical simulations of relativistic jets to quantify how much feedback the jets impart on the surrounding gas. These results will be used to test and ultimately improve the simpler prescriptions routinely used in large-scale cosmological galaxy formation models, which do not have sufficient resolution to faithfully represent the jet feedback process.
The successful candidate will also use a state-of-the-art model for calculating the jet synchrotron emission, observable with radio telescopes. Simulated jets will be compared with observations from leading international telescopes, including Australian and international Square Kilometre Array pathfinder instruments ASKAP, MWA and LOFAR, to determine the relationship between observable radio emission and feedback imparted on intergalactic gas.

Benzodiazepine pharmacokinetics and withdrawal,"There is evidence that rapid metabolism of potentially addictive substances can exacerbate drug withdrawal effects and increase the difficulty associated with cessation. In the limited areas where this concept has been explored, findings have demonstrated important clinical implications related to the selection of appropriate withdrawal strategies based on speed of metabolism and subsequent drug elimination. For example, fast metabolisers of nicotine find smoking cessation more difficult. Similarly, with opioid dependence, harm minimisation strategies have successfully utilised long-acting methadone treatment regimens.
Benzodiazepines are a class of highly addictive, centrally acting medications that are eliminated through various metabolic pathways. Use of benzodiazepines is associated with significant adverse effects and morbidity in the community, particularly in older people, patients taking multiple central nervous system depressants and intravenous drug users. However, cessation of these medications is challenging due to high dependence on their use and the development of withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepine metabolism is complex with active metabolites and the involvement of multiple cytochrome P450 and glucuronidation metabolic pathways contributing to significant potential for inter-individual pharmacogenetic variability.
This project aims to develop a method to detect benzodiazepines and metabolites in finger prick samples (dried blood spot) to assess metabolism phenotype of benzodiazepine users. This data will then be used to investigate the relationship between dependence and metabolism phenotype in a clinical setting using an observational design and answer the question whether withdrawal symptoms and success is determined by metabolism phenotype.
The project will involve several Tasmanian stakeholders, including Tasmania’s Alcohol and Drug Services and private psychiatry practices.

Frailty and Pain,"Approximately half of the people in Residential Aged Care settings meet the criteria for frailty.  Frailty has an array of adverse outcomes for older people and is known to negatively impact on health-related quality of life. Like frailty, the prevalence of pain also increases with age. Often pain and frailty co-exist and there is some evidence that persistent pain may be a causal risk factor for frailty. Pain in long terms care settings (esp. people with dementia) is often under assessed and poorly managed, while frailty is not routinely screened or assessed. This Project will focus on better understanding the relationship between persistent pain and frailty in older adults living within residential aged care services and improving processes for recognition and assessment of these two conditions.
This research will adopt a participatory, co-design approach with mixed methods of data collection. The initial phase of this study will involve baseline data collection to understand what indicators of persistent pain and frailty are present in the aged care population and how there are currently measured. Subsequent phases of the study will focus on working in partnership with participating aged care services to enhance how pain and frailty are recognised and assessed, to ensure proactive and consistent evidenced-based assessment and management of these conditions.

Family Based Care/UTAS Reablement,"This PhD scholarship builds upon the funded reablement project, in partnership with Family Based Care in Northern Tasmania. The study will explore ways in which clients and carers of clients of Family Based Care can be engaged better with the reablement process.  Outcomes are likely to be structures and processes that provide better support for these clients and carers in the community. It fits into the Aged Care priority for the School of Nursing, as well as Health Services research.
Applicants may be considered for part-time candidature. In addition, the successful applicant (particularly if they are an Allied Health Professional) may be considered for part-time paid clinical work with Family Based Care in line with RTP guidelines.

Enhanced sensory care for older people,"This project is part of a larger research program in the School of Nursing that focuses on frailty in older people.
Home care packages (HCP) are designed to support older people with complex needs to remain in their own homes for as long as possible and provide a range of services based on assessed need. The highest level of HCP provides home assistance, meal preparation, transportation and nursing services. However, unmet needs of community-living people (both with and without dementia) are common, often non-medical and include a lack of meaningful activity, physical engagement and social connectedness. Quality of life assessment is one of the indicators recommended for evaluating quality care within home care services.
The majority of HCP are subsidised by the Australian Government to assessed clients with Level 1 providing basic care and Level 4 providing advanced care. However, even with a Level 4 package the psychosocial care needs of the person with high level care needs are often neglected for a focus on personal and clinical care. Many older people receiving a HCP report a lack of meaningful relationships with care providers and little flexibility in their care package to include home activities that increase engagement, and quality of life.
This research will adopt a participatory, co-design approach with mixed methods data collection. The initial phase of this study will involve baseline data collection to describe the amount of sensory input older people receive within the care plans of existing home care packages. Subsequent phases of the study will provide enhanced sensory care for a subset of older people who receive a home care package. Evaluate the impact of the enhanced care program on the i) wellbeing and quality of life of the older person ii) care experiences of the older people; and, evaluate the impact of an enhanced care package on (i) family caregivers' perceptions of care quality following the enhanced care intervention and (ii) burden of caregiving.

Co-designed frailty indicators,"Frailty is a syndrome of physiological decline that occurs later in the life trajectory associated with increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes (Wryko 2015). Frailty identification and subsequent management has implications for individuals, clinical practice, and public health. As the population of older people increases, frailty is recognised as a growing health burden with increased health concerns, including poor quality of life, increased falls and poor mobility, admission to residential care or hospitalisation. Evidence based frailty screening tools are available, but their usability and relationship to caregivers is not known. This project will use a co-design mixed methods research study to examine the factors that contribute toward generation of frailty scores and how they can be adapted for use by caregivers and the elderly to escalate decisions for quality-of-life care.
Frailty screening and assessment tools use similar classification or scoring systems that require either self-reported, deficit scoring or health practitioner clinical judgement on the degree of frailty. This then may be used to infer care delivery or end of life decision making. Frailty scores can assist to identify older people at high risk who can then receive targeted interventions to delay admission to residential aged care (Khadka et al. 2020). There is a paucity of research focussed on frailty in aged care facilities despite the high population of frail older people. The input that the client/patient or family/caregiver has in terms of determining the frailty score and then, at what point care is escalated or deescalated is unknown. The use of personalised frailty tools in older persons care organisations is unclear, and the co-contribution that caregivers including family members has into the design and use of such tools is not known. A co-designed project is anticipated to address the care planning for individuals at risk of the consequences of frailty.

The last 1000 days with chronic disease,"Kidney failure was previously an untreatable fatal illness, but treatments such as dialysis are now widely available. It is an imperfect treatment, with a significant burden in some, particularly older people, contributing to a progressive decline in quality of life. Similar to other chronic diseases, the information currently available to inform elderly people does not always address their needs and is somewhat limited, particularly around the consequences of not having dialysis treatment.
Using mixed methods, this project will address the following aims:
To address these aims, this project will require both quantitative and qualitative analysis. We will use the CKD.TASlink dataset (2004-2020) to address aims 1 & 2. This unique dataset links existing Tasmanian state-wide datasets (including death registry, cancer registry, admitted patient dataset and ED presentation dataset) to two pathology providers. This established dataset consists of 460,737 Tasmanians including 56,438 with kidney disease (Saunder et al 2021).
For Aim 3 we will conduct focus groups and semi-structured interviews with health professionals and people with kidney failure to ascertain what information is important to them and their preferences to inform shared decision-making around using (or not) kidney replacement therapy (dialysis & transplant).
Knowing how people prefer to use their time in the last 1000 days with kidney failure has broad application to people living with other chronic conditions.

Public health approaches to Ambulance Tas data,"Ambulance Tasmania provides emergency and non-emergency services to people requiring medical assistance and/or transportation.  Demand for ambulance services is growing at an unsustainable rate. The utilisation of ambulance services grew 14 times faster than Tasmania’s population from 2003 to 2017.
Using data and evidence to inform public health approaches within Ambulance Tasmania could lead to improved population health outcomes, tackle inequities, and challenge the demands placed on the ambulance service and wider health services by preventable causes.
This interdisciplinary project will use data collected by Ambulance Tasmania to evaluate the outcomes of calls to their service.  The project will analyse the data collected from time of first call to Ambulance Tasmania through to the patient’s final outcome, and will explore outcomes and potential inequities associated with demographic profiles, including location of patient.  This project will also explore the utility of extended care practitioners in alleviating the need to transfer patients to hospitals.

Paramedics and emergency dental care,"The public health burden of dental injuries is great, with immediate and long-term costs and consequences at individual, family and community levels. Immediate burdens include the acute management of the injury, which is often painful or distressing for the individual and their families. This is further complicated because a dental emergency is a severe medical situation and requires immediate attention at a dental facility for consideration. In general, hospital emergency rooms do not have a dentist on staff.
There is a scarcity of data regarding traumatic dental injuries (TDI) and isolated dental injuries (IDI) worldwide, including their presentation in hospitals across Australia. Less is known about the emergency response of paramedic services and the role and competency of paramedics in both initial treatment and referral to specialist pathways. With national increases in preventable dental hospitalisation, this Project, offers the opportunity to work with leading scholars in Public Health and Paramedicine to evaluate the interdisciplinary response of health services to dental injuries in the community accessing data from current services in Tasmania. The research will also determine the detail of education and practice in paramedic programs of dental emergency management. This provides the opportunity to explore the development of professional competencies specific skills in other fields. Professionals must recognise their role in treating oral injuries and preventing compounding conditions. Overall this Project offers the opportunity to improve dental health outcomes and potential collaborative relationships between paramedic and primary care providers in Australian communities.

Optogenetic and sonogenetic with TRPA1,"The project is part of the funded (and extended) ARC fellowship (2016-2022) aimed to develop a novel optogenetic and sonogenetic approach to manipulate neuronal membrane excitability. Our laboratory has previously developed novel channelrhodopsin mutants to manipulate neuronal membrane excitability but channelrhodopsins suffer from low conductance and lack spectral separation. Using photosensitising fluorescent proteins or fluorescent dyes and the mammalian membrane channel that can be activated by reactive oxygen species, we have established that it is possible to use light to control membrane excitability with better spectral separation and high efficiency. The project will aim to further validate and characterise the approach, develop ways to deliver the tools using recombinant virus and test whether the approach can be modified to become a multi-modal neuromodulatory approach to control neuronal excitability with ultrasound. This project will develop important and novel tools for general neuroscientific research that address the current shortcomings and limitations of current tools and contribute to the tools available to the international neuroscientific research communities.

Measurement of neuropeptide release,"The project is part of the funded NHMRC grant (2021-2023) aims utilise a novel fluorescent sensor to measure the release of neuropeptides in vivo during a rodent model of learning and memory. The peptides of interests, oxytocin and AVP, are known to associate with the emotional response associated with learning and formation of memory. Using a GPCR-based fluorescent sensor from a collaborator, Professor Yu-long Li and a custom-built fibre photometry system, the project will measure the release of oxytocin and AVP in real-time in freely moving animal as they undergo fear-conditioning learning. A second aim of the project is to develop an alternative system of measuring neuropeptide release using releasable fluorescent protein fragments as a surrogate for amount of neuropeptide release. This second aim was part of a grant previously funded by NIH in which the amount of fluorescence from complemented fluorescent proteins will inform us the amount of neuropeptide release during the behaviour in post-mortem histology. These projects will both develop and validate novel technologies for neuroscientific researches and also uncovers important roles of neuropeptides in neurophysiological functions.

Fit for purpose medical professionals,"Leading the growing international recognition of the need for public health and sustainability in healthcare delivery, the Australian Medical Council (AMC) has mandated that newly qualified doctors must be able to apply the principles of social-population health to medical practice.  However, there is little consensus to how these principles are taught.
Core elements of medical education anchored in social accountability and medical humanities can foster interdisciplinary learning and research optimising sustainable doctor, patient and community health and wellbeing. This model aims to support the student to achieve a deeper reflective understanding of themselves, learn to identify and respond to society’s health care needs and measure the impact on society. Underpinned by social justice, it provides an evidence-based framework for the medical curriculum to address health determinants and disparities. (1-3)
Health and Society (Domain 3) is one of four AMC themes that run through the University of Tasmania (UTAS) medical degree that teaches population-social health. Over the past two years a new blended learning social accountability medical humanities informed curriculum has been developed and implemented for years 1-3 and is planned for years 4-5, 2022-23. This content includes the use of a novel narrative-based case study. It is unclear if this framework (how and what we teach) is effective in the Tasmania context.

Evaluating a Mental Health Co-Responder Program,"People experiencing an acute mental health crisis often rely on ambulance and emergency department services as their primary point of access for health services. Recent years have seen substantial growth in ambulance service workloads, approximately 10% of which are mental health emergencies.  People seeking assistance for crisis situations can often face significant wait times due to service demands.  To address these delays and improve access to services, a pilot Mental Health Co-Responder Program is being implemented in Southern Tasmania, operated jointly by Tasmanian Mental Health Services, Ambulance Tasmania and Tasmania Police.
In this project you will work with leading scholars in Paramedicine, Policing and Psychology to evaluate the impact of this pilot project.  You will have access to data from the key service providers from which you will develop an understanding of the demand for services, characteristics of service delivery and patient outcomes.  You will have the opportunity from this data to develop recommendations for program review and improvement throughout and beyond its pilot stage.

Clinical handover improvement follow-up,"Medical errors are common. One of the highest risk activities in clinical practice is during clinical care transition, such as clinical handover, patient care transfer or discharge.
The University of Tasmania in collaboration with the Royal Hobart Hospital conducted the primary research in clinical handover from 2014-2018, which subsequently formed the Australian National Clinical Handover guideline and the Australian Healthcare Accreditation Standard 6. The research also informed the World Health Organisation standardised operating protocol for clinical handover improvement.
Despite widespread utilisation of standardised operating protocols in clinical handover, issues associated with clinical handover continue to affect patient care. Furthermore, longitudinal follow up of large-scale systemic patient safety interventions has been lacking, especially in clinical handover. This study aims to address these issues by conducting evaluation of clinical handover practices at the primary site of initial research that derive the standardised practice, led by the team of initial researchers, to understand factors that determine outcomes of patient safety initiatives especially in clinical handover.
This research aims to understand current clinical handover practices, two decades after the initial clinical handover improvement projects at the primary site, in order to provide guidance on longitudinal outcomes of large-scale patient safety interventions.

This project will utilise published research methodology in previous studies, at the original pilot site, to gain insights into the impact of patient safety interventions. Potential candidates are advised to read through previous publications by the supervisor on this topic prior to discussion on potential specific projects

Antibody mimetics for synapse modulation,"The project is part of the funded NHMRC grant (2021-2024) and will develop several antibody mimetic protein domains that can modulate the synaptic functions of neurons. Alteration of synaptic function is implicated in all neurological conditions and this either takes the form of reduced synaptic transmission or incorrect changes in synaptic strength. One of the key approaches to understand synaptic function is to experimentally manipulate proteins at the synapse but these often is done at transcription or translation level, or involves overexpression of exogenous altered proteins. The ability to be able to manipulate the native proteins expressed in the cells would provide a more accurate insight into understanding synaptic function and reflect the true functions of synaptic proteins. To do this, the project will develop single-domain antibody domain or fibronectin III domain based antibody mimetics that can be expressed intracellularly and bind to native synaptic proteins. In doing so, these proteins can either act as activator or inhibitors of the protein function directly, modified to alter the rate of degradation, or modified to be optogenetically or chemogenetically controlled. The goal of the project is first to establish a pipeline to develop the single-domain nanobody and fibronectin III domains based on mRNA- and phage-display approaches and develop the binders to the intracellular domain of BDNF receptor TrkB and calcium dependent phosphatase calcineurin. TrkB is implicated in long term potentiation and calcineurin is implicated in long term depression which are key mechanism of changing synaptic strength and believed to be the cellular basis of learning and memory formation. Once the 'hits' are identified, these protein domains will be validated in cell culture for selective binding in the cells and screen for functional disruption of these proteins. Ultimately, the some hits will be further developed as neuroscience tools to optogenetically alter synaptic plasticity.

Walkability in rural communities,"Regular physical activity plays an important role in maintaining good health and preventing conditions like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. Physical activity is lower, and rates of these conditions higher, in rural Australia. The built and natural environments where we live, work and play influence how active we are, yet research around environmental influences on physical activity is largely urban-focused. This urban research suggests more 'walkable' environments support physical activity, but currently little is known about how to measure walkability or what the key barriers and enablers to walkability are in rural communities.
The PhD project is situated within a Medical Research Future Fund project known as 'Communities for Walkability' (https://walkrural.com.au/). The Communities for Walkability project has developed an online audit tool to support rural communities to collect information about the walkability of their town. In each of 10 Tasmanian towns, data collected via the tool are used to inform a community workshop to identify key themes and priorities for action. Using citizen science and co-design approaches the research team work closely with local leaders and residents in rural Tasmanian communities during data collection, analysis, and interpretation to identify areas for change.
This PhD project will address some/all of the following research questions depending on the interests/skills of the successful candidate:
The project will involve a narrative or systematic literature review, and collection and analysis of data from qualitative interviews, focus groups, photographs, and policy documents.

The impact of the gut microbiome on bone health in children,"Over 1 million Australians suffer from osteoporosis, and this is likely to increase due to our ageing population and sedentary behaviour. The importance of bone acquisition in childhood and adolescence to optimize peak bone mass has been recognized as one of the key strategies in the prevention of osteoporotic fractures. A better understanding of the determinants of bone acquisition from infancy through childhood is therefore of fundamental importance to the prevention of osteoporosis in adulthood.
The gut microbiome plays an important role in shaping complex traits and diseases. Evidence is emerging that the gut microbiota affects bone homeostasis. The relationship is complex and involves several mechanisms including: (1) host immune system, (2) modulation of growth factor and hormone production, and (3) the production of specific metabolites, such as short chain fatty acids. To establish whether a different gut microbiota composition is related to subsequent bone health in childhood, longitudinal cohort studies in the general population are essential. This project will directly address this need by investigating the role of the gut microbiota on bone health during childhood.
The project aims to examine the association between:
The research will be conducted in two population-based observational birth-cohorts: the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC) from Denmark and the Barwon Infant Study (BIS) from Australia. In a total of 1,500 children, faecal samples were collected during infancy and childhood to characterize the microbiome and its derived metabolites in faeces, urine and blood and bone health will be determined at age 6-11 years.

"Sleep, obesity and cardiometabolic health","Cardiometabolic disease (cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with premature deaths preventable. Much of the prevention effort is focused on lifestyle modification and management of clinical risk factors in older adults but risk factors emerge as early as childhood, such as sleep-related characteristics including its duration, quality, and timing. Adequate sleep is important for children’s healthy growth, learning and development. Insufficient sleep has been linked to a range of detrimental physical and psychosocial health problems. Over the past century, there have been rapid declines in the sleep duration among children and adolescents, with over half of middle school students and approximately three quarters of high school students did not get recommended amount of sleep.
The association of sleep with cardiometabolic health outcomes has been well established among adults and pooled evidence supported a U-shaped relationship with both short and long duration of sleep were associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic health. There have been very few longitudinal studies examining the long-term association of sleep, obesity and cardiometabolic health across the life course frame from childhood. The Childhood Determinants of Adult Health (CDAH) study commenced across Australia in 1985 with a representative sample of 8,498 children aged 7-15 years from 109 schools. Using data from repeated measures of lifestyle, physical characteristics and mental health collected since childhood, the study's long-term aim is to determine the contribution of childhood factors to the risk of developing cardiometabolic disease.
Utilising CDAH data, this project aims to address the aforementioned research gap by answering the following questions: 1. How do sleep characteristics vary across different life periods including childhood, young and mid-adulthood? 2. What is the lifecourse association between sleep and obesity? 3. What is the association of sleep from childhood to mid-adulthood with cardiometabolic health (e.g. prediabetes, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, carotid plaque and elasticity, cardiac structure and function) in mid-adulthood?

Rare variant identification for preeclampsia,"Preeclampsia is a complex pregnancy specific disorder characterized by new onset hypertension and proteinuria affecting 3 - 8% of pregnant women. Preeclampsia is known to be a heritable disease and while there has been success in the identification of some genes, these identified variants do not explain all the expected genetic variation.  This project aims to identify novel rare genetic variation in families with a history of preeclampsia that may explain some of this “missing heritability”. You will use advanced bioinformatic workflows for whole-genome-sequencing to identify novel rare variants that segregate with preeclampsia in these families. Independent cohorts and publicly available databases will then be used to further screen these variants. This information will then be integrated with transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets to prioritise potential functional or regulatory variants associated with preeclampsia. This will provide new information on the molecular aetiology of preeclampsia and in the future may help identify those women most at risk of developing this disease.

Onset-specific health economics of multiple sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex autoimmune/neurodegenerative disease in which the myelin sheath covering nerve fibres in the central nervous system (brain, optic nerves and spinal cord) is damaged, leading to increasing disability over time, which in turn, negatively impacts individuals’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and poses a significant economic burden to patients and society in terms of both direct (healthcare) and indirect costs (from lost productivity). According to the onset type, people with MS can be grouped into the categories of relapse onset MS (ROMS) including relapsing forms of MS (i.e., relapsing remitting MS and secondary progressive MS) and progressive onset MS (PROMS) including primary progressive MS and progressive relapsing MS.
There are clear differences between the two onset types in several aspects including the prevalence, gender ratio, age at onset, disease duration, symptom presentation, disability severity, treatments, and treatment response: resulting in significant health economic impact (i.e.: health state utility [HSU], costs, disability progression and mortality/survival) differences between PROMS and ROMS. Some studies (mostly conducted in Europe and the United States) have estimated the health and economic impacts by MS sub-types.

"Potentially Preventable Hospitalisations (PPH) in Tasmania: who, why and where?","Many health conditions can be effectively managed and treated in primary and community health care. If this care is unavailable or not accessed, individuals may require hospital care that was avoidable. Such hospital admissions are referred to as Potentially Preventable Hospitalisations (PPHs), and are used as a proxy measure of the effectiveness of primary and community health care. Twenty-two health conditions have been identified by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care as PPHs.
In 2017/18, PPHs accounted for 1 in 15 hospital admissions and 1 in 10 hospital bed days nationally. For Tasmania, in 2016/17, there were 13,889 admissions and 52,469 bed days. PPHs can be reduced by improving access and availability of primary care and community health care services. In turn, reducing the number of PPHs would reduce the impact on Tasmanian public hospitals in relation to bed block and ambulance ramping  and will  provide better health outcomes for patients.
The aims of this study are to:
The proposed PhD project will use linked data from the Tasmanian Admitted Patients Dataset and Emergency Department Dataset, along with National Health Services Directory. For aim 4, focus groups and 1:1  semi-structured interviews will be conducted. Please note part of this project is currently under review with the Royal Hobart Hospital Research Foundation (Project Grant, $25,000).

Obesity and musculoskeletal pain,"Musculoskeletal pain is a major public health burden worldwide. It is common in the general population with a prevalence estimated as high as 70%, leading to restrictions in physical function and mobility impairments including reduced quality of life and disability. Obesity is often comorbid with musculoskeletal pain. We have demonstrated that obesity and fat mass are associated with musculoskeletal pain occurring in non-weightbearing joints and obesity-related factors (e.g., metabolic syndrome) increase the risk of experiencing severe pain. However, the two conditions may be related reciprocally in a bidirectional manner and the precise mechanisms underlying the two phenomena have not been clear. This project will address this gap and examine the mechanistic links between obesity and obesity-related factors and musculoskeletal pain based on two large population-based cohorts. It will utilize genetic and observational longitudinal data.

Molecular drivers of prostate cancer metastasis,"The vast majority of deaths associated with solid tumours are due to metastatic disease. Aggressive prostate cancers (PrCa) are particularly problematic as these tumours have a high propensity to metastasise to bone. Five-year survival for men with bone metastatic PrCa lesions is ~6%, and current therapies available are both limited and largely ineffective. Lethality-based genome-wide (CRISPR/Cas9) screens are an innovative technique used to uncover the genes that underpin complex disease, the outcomes of which are seeding important advances particularly for cancer treatment. We have performed a successful lethality-based genome-wide screen in an aggressive prostate cancer cell line (isolated from a patient with bone metastases) and identified several mitochondrial-associated genes as the top ranked genes driving survival and metastatic behaviour. Mitochondria, as the cell’s powerhouse, are known to sustain tumour cell proliferation and survival, and this project seeks to uncover how these genes are critical to the metastatic cell state in PrCa, and further how this knowledge can be harnessed to develop much needed therapeutic interventions for metastatic disease. Our close clinical collaboration with both public and private prostate cancer treatment service providers has enabled us to develop a rare clinically annotated biospecimen resource comprising matched primary and metastatic tumour specimen.
In this project we will explore the functionality of the identified genes and their role in influencing cell proliferation, migration and mitochondrial functional assays

For example slow gait speed at preferred speed is associated with future risk of dementia.  However, the association between other motor functions such as dual-task walking, fast pace walking, frailty and hand function with cognition, is not yet fully understood.  Such simple and inexpensive tests would be extremely useful if able to help predict who might develop dementia.
This cross-sectional observational study will include participants from the ISLAND Clinic, which is the Tasmanian Dementia and Cognition Clinic located in the Clinical Research Facility of UTAS, Hobart. The ISLAND Clinic was established by the Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre in February 2021.
This project will examine the utility and underling brain pathways of motor function in relation to a dementia risk assessment.

Investigating chronic plantar heel pain,"CPHP is a chronic musculoskeletal condition that affects up to 10% of adults in their lifetime. It is the most common reason why individuals with musculoskeletal foot pain consult a healthcare practitioner, and is frequently recalcitrant to treatment.
The Plantar HEEl Pain Study (PHEEPS) is the largest case-control and longitudinal follow-up of CPHP cases that we are aware of and was recently completed at Menzies by a previous student. We now have access to this large, curated database with further opportunities to explore risk and prognostic factors associated with CPHP. This data will help improve our understanding of CPHP phenotypes and inform treatment targeting, with the view to testing interventions specific to these phenotypes.
A large unexplored area of research potential is the investigation of metabolic and meta-inflammatory biomarkers in CPHP. As part of the PHEEPS project we have collected blood samples on cases and controls (at baseline). Metabolic factors have not been assessed in CPHP but this is important as they have been associated with tendon disease elsewhere, and our own and other research indicates that obesity including waist girth is strongly associated with heel pain risk.
This extensive database can support further investigation into bone and imaging factors in CPHP as well as treatment, physical activity and footwear factors.
There is also potential to extend the longitudinal follow up of cases (beyond the current 12 months), and to use our newly understanding of CPHP to design clinical trials for the condition, for example targeting bone (‘Bone Marrow Lesions’) in the calcaneus to trial a bone-specific treatment targeting this specific CPHP phenotype.

Literacy as a fundamental social determinant of (mental) health,"Good brain health is an emerging concept that the WHO has defined as a state in which every individual can optimise their cognitive, emotional, psychological, and behavioural functioning; not merely the absence of disease. Brain health has been postulated as the key to health, the brain “the agent of all our actions and the mediator of all our experiences”. With a strong association between social disadvantage and poor mental health, poverty, childhood adversity, and violence are key individual risk factors for mental disorders. Most mental health conditions begin in childhood and given long-term and pervasive impacts, prevention through to recovery are thus societal and economic imperatives
Interventions targeting common mental disorders and their risk factors have their largest effects during childhood and adolescence, emphasising the need to target developmentally sensitive periods in the life course. At the individual level, maternal and child health, education, employment and quality of work, and healthy ageing are key foci. Limited literacy is an important and under-examined factor contributing to the health disparities experienced by people with mental illness.
Tasmanian children, around 24% of the state’s population, experience the highest levels of socio-economic disadvantage of children in any Australian jurisdiction. Tasmania has the highest self-reported prevalence of mental health problems among adults in 2014-15. Tasmania has the lowest levels of functional literacy in Australia.
This PhD program will explore the role of literacy difficulties as a social determinant of poor (mental) health in young Tasmanians and, whether this is an inter-generational story within the Tasmanian context. The research program will employ mixed methods, with an initial focus on:

Identifying acute stroke triggers,"When Mrs Smith presents to hospital following her ischaemic stroke, we can tell her that her high BP, obesity, and history of smoking contributed to her stroke, but we cannot answer the question of ‘
The project will use a large, linked dataset including around 500,000 Tasmanians that used a pathology service between 2004 and 2020. Linkage to emergency department presentations, hospital admissions and deaths will be used to identify incident strokes during the time period. Comparison non-stroke incident events will also be identified such as for cardiac or respiratory diseases. The project will use statistical modelling working with big data to identify novel risk factors including health service contacts (e.g. hospitalisation presentations, pathology, antenatal services) among people later presenting with stroke compared to other non-stroke conditions.
This research will identify risk factors for acute stroke to inform a range of interventions, such as targeted GP referrals for people who are identified as being at high risk of stroke prior to discharge for a non-stroke admission. This PhD project is part of the Synergies to Prevent Stroke (STOPstroke) NHMRC Synergy Grant program, contributing to theme 1 around ‘Better prediction of those that will suffer stroke’.

Healthy lifestyle score and CVD health,"Cardiometabolic disease (including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally and in Australia, with premature deaths largely preventable. Much of the prevention effort is focused on lifestyle modification and management of clinical risk factors in older adults but risk factors are common at young ages. Their prevalence estimates in young adults aged 18 to 44 from the 2017-18 Australian Health Survey confirm this: overweight and obesity (58.7%), physical inactivity (80.6%), less than recommended intake of fruit and vegetables (96%) and smoking (16.9%). Investigation of lifestyle risk factors can be complex because they often coexist (i.e. people with overweight or obesity are more likely to be physically inactive), thus a healthy lifestyle score has been used to summarise lifestyle risk factors as a whole. Few longitudinal studies have examined the longitudinal associations of healthy lifestyle scores from childhood to adulthood with cardiometabolic health outcomes in adulthood.
The Childhood Determinants of Adult Health (CDAH) study commenced across Australia in 1985 with a representative sample of 8,498 children aged 7-15 years from 109 schools. Using data from repeated measures of lifestyle, physical characteristics and mental health collected since childhood, the study's long-term aim is to determine the contribution of childhood factors to the risk of developing CVD.
Using CDAH data, this project aims to address the research gap by expanding the healthy lifestyle score measurements to multiple life periods (from four-time points including childhood), identifying its sociodemographic determinants in childhood, and examining its association and the contribution of different parts of the healthy lifestyle score with cardiometabolic health outcomes in midlife, including diabetes and prediabetes, metabolic syndrome, and blood vessel (i.e. plaque and elasticity) and heart (i.e. left ventricular hypertrophy and global longitudinal strain) related CVD outcomes in midlife. Findings from this project will inform targeted prevention strategies across the life course to reduce the incidence of cardiometabolic disease.

Health literacy and cardiovascular health," Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. While overt CVD may not appear until later in life, the risk factors for CVD begin to develop in childhood and are associated with adverse outcomes in adulthood. Although a large amount of the burden of CVD can be attributed to modifiable behavioural risk factors, a major challenge is initiating and maintaining behaviour change, which may in part be due to inadequacies in health literacy. Whilst health promotion activities are common in the school environment, unless children are health literate such activities will never be sustainable, because health promotion cannot be achieved in isolation from health literacy. Tasmanian children have some of the worst health profiles in the nation (30% of children are overweight compared to 25% nationally). Thus, there is a critical need to develop effective and feasible strategies to better the cardiovascular health (CVH) of some of Australia’s most unhealthy children, to stem the future burden of CVD.
 This project will leverage an existing childhood health literacy program (HealthLit4Kids) which has already been rolled out in 5 Tasmanian schools. HealthLit4Kids is a 1-year intervention co-designed with key stakeholders and aligned with the Australian school curriculum which aims to increase health literacy in children, their families and communities. However, whether HealthLit4Kids has beneficial effects on children’s CVH knowledge and CVH is yet to be determined. This extension of HealthLit4Kids will involve the assessment of CVH knowledge (primary outcome) and objective CVH (secondary outcomes, diet, physical activity, blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, BMI, smoking exposure) in children pre- and post-intervention.

"Finances, Employment and Prostate Cancer","Financial toxicity, or the financial impact of the treatment of cancer, is a growing issue for people affected by cancer. The impact of cancer on employment, for both people with cancer and their carers and families, can be significant. People with cancer or their carers in rural and regional areas may experience additional challenges.
Although prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis for men in many countries, information on the employment experience of people with prostate cancer is relatively limited. Furthermore, few of these studies have been conducted in Australia. Given differences across countries in employment and social support systems, Australian-specific research is needed. In addition, although there is growing recognition of financial toxicity for carers in cancer, research on this topic is comparatively limited.
The proposed PhD will evaluate survivor and carer perspectives and experiences regarding financial impact, return to work and work engagement for people affected by prostate cancer. The project will enhance student knowledge of surveys and questionnaires and provide opportunities to use different techniques and analytic approaches.

"Fitness, cardiovascular risk, and exercise blood pressure","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the greatest cause of morbidity worldwide, and high blood pressure (BP) is the number one risk factor for CVD. One in three Tasmanian adults has high BP, the highest prevalence in Australia. Many more have undiagnosed or inadequately managed high BP, further increasing CVD risk. Thus, we have an urgent and currently unmet need for improved and easily implemented methods for better detection and management of high BP and its associated CVD risk.
Work of the supervisory team has demonstrated that abnormally raised BP during clinical exercise testing, called ‘exercise hypertension’, is a signal for CVD events and death. This CVD risk may, however, not be detected in up to 50% of individuals using traditional methods of BP assessment at rest. Thus, exercise BP offers a unique opportunity to identify individuals at high risk for BP-related CVD.
Several factors (including, but not limited to, functional capacity – ‘fitness’) have been shown to influence exercise BP, and its subsequent association with CVD outcomes. The relationship between exercise BP and functional capacity suggests there may be both pathological and physiological pathways to generating abnormal exercise BP. Physiological insight to the cardiac structure and function that underpins these differential BP responses to exercise, as well as the associated longer-term CVD risk is lacking (the supervisor team recently wrote an invited review article on this issue).
The proposed PhD program will address this key knowledge gap relating to exercise BP with the goal to understand how fitness mediates the relationship between elevated exercise BP and CVD risk. Data to address the project aims will be drawn from the EXERcise stress Test collaboratION (EXERTION) study, a collaborative established by the supervisory team to enhance clinical understanding of abnormal exercise BP.

Exploring the health benefits of greater fitness,"In Australia, we are in the enviable position to have the Childhood Determinants of Adult Health (CDAH) Study, which is based out of the Menzies Institute for Medical Research. The CDAH Study is the only established study worldwide that has collected multiple physical fitness measurements, including cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular fitness, on participants when they were children, followed them for over three decades and assessed their health and fitness as adults. In adulthood, a range of measures have been collected, including a blood and urine sample, heart and blood vessel measures, blood pressure, measures of adiposity, diet, and depression. As such, we are uniquely placed to address global research gaps by identifying how physical fitness measured at multiple time-points across someone’s life is associated with a range of health outcomes. To provide an overview of how our research group has contributed to current understanding, using data collected from the CDAH Study we have shown that children with higher levels of physical fitness are less likely to develop risk factors for diabetes and heart attack, such as prediabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, beta cell function, obesity, inflammation, and blood lipids, up to 30 years later in adulthood. However, knowledge gaps remain.
Combining the data already collected as part of the CDAH Study and different analytic techniques, this project will examine the association between measures of fitness collected at one or several time-points over the 30+–year study period and a health outcome of interest to both the candidate and the wider Tasmanian community. Whether the potential candidate prefers studying biochemical measures or has a passion for cardiovascular disease, diet, or mental health – we encourage you to get in touch with us to discuss the study, potential project ideas, and how best we can work together.

Evaluating the clinical utility of osteoarthritis pain phenotypes,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and is the leading cause of pain and disability. With the growing aging population, along with the increase in obesity, OA has become a huge societal and economic burden in the developed world. Despite this, there are no effective disease-modifying OA drugs and the existing pain therapies have limited efficacy and a substantial risk of adverse events. OA pain is highly heterogeneous, with pain presentations varying among patients. Therefore, it is not surprising to see far disappointing results from “one-size fits all” treatment approaches in OA pain patients. This project will directly address this need by identifying pain phenotypes and providing an optimal patient selection tool.
We have demonstrated that OA pain consists of distinct phenotypes/subgroups, and their clinical prognoses (e.g., joint replacement, fractures) differ among distinct pain phenotypes in a longitudinal population-based cohort study --Tasmanian Older Adult Cohort Study (TASOAC). These phenotypes appear to be clinically useful for stratifying patients and improving the clinical management of OA pain patients. This project is to evaluate and validate the clinical prognoses of distinct pain phenotypes in TASOAC and an international large cohort study to verify the clinical utility of pain phenotypes, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of the links.

Evaluating the benefits of ultra-low emission wood heaters,"Wood burning is a popular choice for home heating in Tasmania. The consequence is unacceptably high concentrations of air pollution during the colder months in many regions of the state, which has been clearly associated with increased rates of mortality, heart and lung diseases. Newer design ultra-low emissions (ULE) wood burning heaters could potentially offer a solution for regions where wood is a readily available cheaper heating option.
Several ULE heaters are commercially available in other countries (eg New Zealand), but have not had uptake in Australia, where heater standards are not as stringent, and there is scepticism about ULE performance with hardwoods (like eucalypts) typically burnt in Australia, compared with softwood timber (like conifers) that are typically burnt in Europe, North America and New Zealand.
This inter- disciplinary program of work will use the emissions testing facility being constructed at the University to evaluate how ultra-low emission (ULE) wood heaters perform when burning Australian hardwoods. It will apply emissions data to model potential reduction in air pollution by region, health outcomes and economic gains. And it will characterise policy options for addressing this avoidable cause of ill health in the community.

Comparative Effectiveness of Treatments for Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis is a common joint disorder for which there is no cure. Recommendations for the symptomatic management of osteoarthritis include exercise, weight control, education, and self-management as the core treatment option. Muscle-strengthening exercise is effective at improving pain and function in knee osteoarthritis.
Yoga is a mind-body intervention that can provide exercise (increased flexibility, muscle strength, physical balancing, improved fitness) that is consistent with recommendations for knee osteoarthritis. The mind component of yoga (meditation, yoga philosophy) has the potential to increase psychological well-being and reduce stress, improve function, and alleviate osteoarthritis associated pain. Yoga, with its potential for improving musculoskeletal function, nervous system, and sympathetic activity, may therefore have greater benefits than commonly used strengthening exercise. Previous studies of yoga in knee osteoarthritis patients have been of low quality with a high risk of bias (often compared with a usual care group) and did not perform subgroup analyses to identify patients who may specifically benefit from yoga.
Aims:
Positive results from this study can directly lead to the widespread use of an already popular mind-body therapy. Even if the yoga program can demonstrate a significant decrease in pain similar to the currently recommended strengthening exercise program, it will be a valuable additional physical activity option for osteoarthritis patients and easily translatable into clinical practice. Implementing conservative (non-surgical) management strategies for people with knee OA could save the health system $170 million by reducing the demand for expensive knee replacements.

Australian Multiple Sclerosis Carers Study,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an incurable, high-cost, high-burden debilitating neurological disease. As well as directly impacting people with MS, it can also have a profound impact on the lives of those who care for and support them. This support can come from partners, parents, siblings, children or friends, and may be supplemented with paid services. Generally, people with MS rely on more than one person to support them, with roles that differ from person to person. As the disease progresses, the level of support that a person with MS requires will increase, with some receiving a carers allowance from the government.
The Australian Multiple Sclerosis Longitudinal Study (AMSLS) is a large national research platform that includes >2,600 people with MS which make it an ideal platform to create a study in which data from carers/support people can be linked to AMSLS participants.
This project will employ mixed methods to investigate the feasibility of a large prospective cohort study of carers and supporters of people with MS linked to their AMSLS participant.
The overall aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of the creation of a large national cohort of carers of people with MS. To achieve this overall aim this PhD project will:
1: conduct a comprehensive review of the literature regarding the methodologies adopted for investigating carer burden for people with MS including both quantitative and qualitative methods, and network methods.
2: recruit a pilot prospective cohort from the carers and supporters of participants of the AMSLS (~50-100 carers and supporters) linked to their AMSLS participant.
3. employ mixed methods to investigate feasibility of quantitative (e.g. validated carer burden and quality of life instruments, cost diary, MBS/PBS data) and qualitative methods (e.g. free text, focus groups and long interviews) to be used for a larger prospective cohort.

Analysing gene expression and blood cells,"Bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS) are a collection of heterogeneous disorders characterized by decreased production of one or more major hematopoietic lineages, which may be either inherited or acquired. BMFS is caused by inefficient haematopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) stem cells, which means the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets are insufficient to meet physiological needs. Approximately 160 Australians, the majority of whom are children or adolescents, are diagnosed with a BMFS each year. More than 50 percent of these patients will die from their disease. The outcome of these patients has greatly improved in recent years but is still poor for patients who lack a sibling donor and who failed or relapsed after immunosuppressive therapy.
Haematopoiesis involves the lineage-specification of blood cells, and is driven by context and cell-type specific gene expression. Variation in the expression of these genes that govern the differentiation and development of cell lineages directly alters production and activation of different blood cells. When regulation of this process goes awry, disease such as BMFS results. Since nearly all clinically measured hematopoietic traits exhibit extensive variation and are highly heritable, there is tremendous potential and excitement for the future of genetics and applications to understand human haematopoiesis.
We aim to understand the contribution of genetic variation in driving haematopoietic cell development, through dissecting the genetic drivers for haematopoiesis at a single cell resolution. This project will involve a mix of bioinformatics and wet lab work, initially working on the analysis of allelic effects on transcription changes from a cohort of niche BM samples that have already been collected.

Stochastic Models for Conservation,"In populations of endangered species, management strategies referred to as genetic rescue have been advocated in order to help avoid extinction. An example of considerable concern in the Australian context is the conservation management of Tasmanian Devils suffering from the Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), which puts them in danger of extinction. Conservation strategies have been used with the hope of increasing the genetic diversity of the wild population, but this remains a challenging problem. An important factor in this context is the ability to assess the impact of conservation efforts.

A multi-omics study of Multiple Sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating autoimmune neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, caused by an interplay between environmental and genetic factors. So far, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for MS have identified >200 susceptibility regions. However, these susceptibility loci can only explain 38% of the heritability of MS while the remaining heritability has been left unexplained. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of MS will greatly improve preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic and reparative strategies.
To address this significant knowledge gap, this research project will focus on the integrated analysis of complementary data sets obtained from different parts of cell biology such as the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and lipidome to improve understanding of disease pathophysiology. The PhD candidate will combine computational skills with statistical expertise to analysis large MS multi-omics datasets with extensive national and international collaborations. These large datasets include cross-sectional data (e.g. > 6000 whole exome sequencing data) as well as longitudinal follow-up data (e.g., the AusLong study which has followed 279 cases from their first clinical event suggestive of MS for up to 15 years, and has comprehensive data on standardized MS clinical outcomes, personal and lifestyle factors, environmental parameters, and significant omics data).
The PhD candidate will be supported by a strong research team that has already demonstrated significant knowledge impacts. For example, in a recent study published in Nature Communications, we established a pipeline that can integrate genomics and transcriptomic data to investigate tissue- and cell-type-specific enrichment of SNP heritability. Our study provided evidence supporting the pathogenic roles of some tissues and cells in contributing to MS development.

Understanding the role of the consumer in the quest for zero-waste,"An estimated 25,000 tonnes of food waste is generated yearly by catering businesses in Australia[1]. This includes wet waste (food) and dry waste, including non-biodegradable materials (e.g., plastic, cans), generated in restaurants, cafés and other food service outlets. Resource-constrained small and medium-sized businesses struggle to develop capabilities that give them a competitive advantage while simultaneously trying to implement environmentally focussed measures, such as zero-waste operations. However, the consumer has been overlooked as a resource to facilitate businesses to move towards environmentally sustainable practices.
This project aims to identify business and consumer-level resources and capabilities to support zero-waste practices. The successful candidate will use insights from the literature to develop a theoretical framework for considering the consumer’s role in helping businesses transform waste into a resource in zero-waste supply chains. The empirical work will focus on cafés and restaurants in Tasmania, as Hobart, capital of the state is the first in Australia to introduce a ban on single-use plastic takeaway food packaging as part of a wider move to become single-use plastic-free. The successful candidate will conduct surveys and interviews with consumers, businesses and other key stakeholders (e.g., business networks) to understand zero-waste initiatives and practices in the industry. Responses will be analysed using quantitative and qualitative methods.
Insights from this project will be used to identify the resources, capabilities and/or pathways that are key to the development and implementation of waste elimination in Tasmanian businesses, with lessons applicable to businesses grappling with the same challenges elsewhere.

Sustainable future of Australian ports,"Ports are a location with economic, logistics and industrial activities that have significant impacts on environmental sustainability in their regions.  As a critical node in global supply chains, ports play an important roles in contributing to green supply chains. Circular economy is one of the important actions in green supply chain management and ports have been considered as an ideal places to transit toward the circular economy. Particularly, the initiative decarbonisation of maritime transport by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in response to climate change threats has further pushed ports’ involvement in circularity for the next 50 years.
The circular economy in the port context is not only to adopt methods to maximise the efficient use of resources by recycling and minimising emissions and waste but also to consider energy policy in particular renewable energy. Circular economy generates multiple benefits from economic, resource, social and environmental aspects. It provides opportunities to grow economy and shape ports for the next few decades.
This research aims to investigate how Australian ports transit towards to circular economy to pursue a sustainable future.

Smart procurement in supply chain,"To achieve profitable and sustainable growth, supply chains need to adjust rapidly to market conditions (e.g. customer preferences, competitive forces) by predicting and responding to demand especially when it is unplanned. The recent COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the need for being agile in the marketplace as the pandemic has dramatically accelerated the changes in consumers’ demand. Procurement agility will play an influential role in helping firms’ supply chain management to adapt to the new challenges of an increasingly dynamic and complex environment. By opening the door to new opportunities, procurement agility can help supply chains to react to sudden changes in demand, which can be considered as a characteristic of successful procurement organisations because firms with high performing procurement functions outperform their competitors. Agile procurement can cope with uncertainties in a volatile environment by monitoring the key metrics that measure suppliers’ health. For example, it can help firms to identify an alternative supplier that can be joined quickly to the firms’ supply network when the risk of supplying from the original supplier increases. This can be a call for a supply chain that can effectively adjust to a changing marketplace by seamlessly sourcing from multiple locations.
In recent years, world-class procurement professionals have adequately embraced and driven the digital transformation to respond with changing requirements of their customers, both internally and externally. The adoption of industry 4.0 technologies has transformed the way that procurement operates by enabling procurement functions to identify and explore previously untapped sources of value. For example, accessing supplier data has been a challenging task for firms. Industry 4.0 technologies such as the internet of things (IoT) and cloud-based infrastructure are helping firms to be flexibly responsive by collecting, processing and analysing real-time data from various suppliers within the supply network. In addition, as the need for offering new services and products increases, agile procurement teams with deep knowledge of emerging technologies can help firms to reduce their development time by fostering collaborative relationships with innovative suppliers. This means that digitalisation can be an effective tool of agility.
Since the real challenge in digitalising processes is to integrate technology and insights in a way that is both progressive and supports business needs, this project will investigate how digital transformation of the procurement functions can improve firms’ supply chain agility.

Sail vortex of an underwater vehicle,"This project will investigate the underlying physics of the sail trailing vortex of an underwater vehicle and its effects on the vehicle’s performance over a range of sail and hull-casing geometries and manoeuvres.
The motivation behind the research project is that the majority of studies have investigated the hydrodynamic coefficients of various vehicle hull shapes and control surfaces for coefficient-based manoeuvring (CBM) models. However, the effects of the vortex systems generated by the vehicle’s appendages are not yet adequately described by CBM models. This project focuses on the trailing vortex system generated by the vehicle’s ‘sail’, which is the source of the stern-dipping phenomena present in underwater vehicles undergoing  manoeuvres in the horizontal plane. The stern-dipping phenomena is important as it has control and dynamic stability impacts on the manoeuvring vehicle. The primary aim of the project is to develop semi-empirical methods to characterise the effect of the sail trailing vortex system for use in  coefficient-based manoeuvring models. This would include, but not be limited to, the development of the vortex system and its effect on the force distribution on the vehicle. This research project is numerical-based. It uses a combination of Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and vortex methods, with experimental validation based on relevant available open literature.
This research is part of an ongoing collaboration between the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) and the AMC in developing experimental and CFD capabilities to model submarine hydrodynamics and operations.

Maritime transport and sustainable development in Australia,"Since the first cargoes were moved by sea more than 5,000 years ago, maritime transport has been at the forefront of the global economy, easily accounting for most international cargo transport in the modern world. Being the largest continental landmass surrounded by water, Australia must rely on maritime transport to promote international trade and support economic growth. In 2018–19 Australia’s top three goods exports were iron ores and concentrates ($77,189 million), coal ($69,592 million), and natural gas ($49,731 million), which are carried by sea. Managing this enormous movement of cargo in an efficient, safe, and environmentally friendly way therefore plays an essential role in planning for sustainable development in Australia. This research aims to examine how maritime transport can promote Australia’s economy in an efficient, safe, and sustainable manner, providing a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental issues of profitability, safety, and sustainability in the maritime industry.

Safe design: decarbonising shipping,"Shipping industry accounts for 2.6% of the global carbon dioxide emissions, is prompted to find clean energy solutions for decarbonising the industry and achieve the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s greenhouse gas (GHG) emission targets by 2050. The decarbonisation process for marine vessels will require changes to the onboard energy storage and usage as well as the necessary accompanying bunkering infrastructure. This requirement must consider several designs and operational aspects of a vessel. One of the critical aspects is the risk associated with operating with new fuels such as hydrogen. Operations in extreme environments will increase the likelihood of accidents resulting in higher risk exposure. A robust and reliable design is required for future vessels (i.e. ice-breakers) operating in harsh environmental conditions such as in the Antarctic and Arctic regions.
The safety performance of any engineering system originates from decisions taken in different stages of the project lifecycle. Inherently Safer Design (ISD) is one of the most effective risk reduction strategies that can be used to achieve safer and more sustainable vessel operation. Among the possible risk management strategies, the implementation of the inherent safety approach in conceptual design and front-end engineering and design (FEED) stages can significantly reduce the design and safety management costs. Because the degrees of freedom available for system modification is higher at these stages, minimising the requirements for engineered safety devices and related procedures. The inherent safety approach is pointed out as a cost-effective strategy to address the underlying hazards in the early stages of a project.
This project aims to develop a novel framework for designing vessels that can safely operate on decarbonised fuels in the extreme conditions of the Antarctic and Southern Oceans. This research project will address the following objectives:
It is anticipated that the proposed framework can assist developers and regulators in providing guidelines and standards for the design and operation of decarbonised vessels.

Risk mitigation - aging/emerging maritime assets,"Structural deterioration has been a significant concern for the maritime industry. Corrosion causes significant detrimental effects on systems exposed to the marine environment, including oil and gas platforms, naval vessels, subsea pipelines, wave-energy converters and offshore wind structures. Biofouling also imposes adverse effects on maritime structures, for instance, on ships, by reducing their speed and manoeuvrability, which in turn increases fuel consumption and emissions of harmful gases. It has been estimated that frictional drag resulting from biofouling can reduce the speed of a ship by more than 10% and a fouled ship burns 40% more fuel. To maintain a ship from increased biofouling, cleaning of the fouling is performed during dry dock.
The development of anti-fouling and anti-corrosion technologies for marine environments is an area of intense research, given their severe economic and ecological impact on marine biofouling. Numerous anti-fouling methods have been attempted, including surface modification through coating with chemically active compounds, mimicking natural anti-fouling surfaces, engineering different surface topography, electrolytic system and ultrasonic system. However, due to the increased environmental restrictions placed on biocides and their use, there is a need for developing sustainable, environmentally friendly, and non-toxic methods to accomplish corrosion and biofouling prevention and mitigation. There is currently a knowledge gap in developing effective methods for preventing biofouling on steel surfaces immersed in seawater over prolonged operations.
This PhD project will focus on developing a novel framework for understanding the deterioration processes of emerging offshore structures and identifying the most suitable mitigative strategies, including novel surface texturing techniques. The main research objectives to be addressed include:
It is anticipated that such a framework will enable the offshore industries better to manage the safety of their resources and operations, ensuring their sustainability into the future and when adopting new technologies.

Reliability assessment of offshore facilities,"The sustainable offshore development of seafood and renewable energy production systems in Australia is crucial for the Blue Economy development. Included in these prospects for blue economy growth are multi-purpose offshore platforms/facilities (MPOP) which can be realised through co-location and/or integration of seafood and renewable energy production systems. Such co-location/integration would have several synergistic benefits, including shared resources, efficient use of ocean space, less competition amongst other user groups of marine space, reduced operational and maintenance (O&M) costs from possible shared activities and reduced impact on coastal environments and ecosystems. All these benefits can be achieved if an integrated/co-located MPOP can operate safely and reliably. However, because of different structural and operational specifications/limitations of the devices used for aquaculture and offshore energy production, the reliability assessment of the integrated/co-located systems is a challenging task.
An emerging field of research in reliability assessment of novel systems involves the use of the Digital Twins (DT) concept. The pairing of the virtual and physical worlds allows analysis of data and monitoring of systems to identify the problems before they even occur, preventing downtime. The DT utilises sensory data and physical models for replicating the structure and evaluating its reliability real-time. The concept has been adopted by the aerospace industry for years, for service-life management and optimisation of airplanes and space shuttles.
Implementing the DT framework however is not straight forward because of the different structural and operational limitations of the aquaculture and renewable energy devices integrated within an MPOP and the lack of structural monitoring guidelines. Solving this issue requires utilisation and coupling of different environmental, structural and failure models, optimal utilisation of different sensors etc. The physical models used within DT frameworks are not certain and there are different degrees of uncertainty associated with each one of them. Improper use of sensors for structural and operational monitoring also increases the uncertainty. Such uncertainties increase the risk of predictions obtained by a DT. This research intends to address the uncertainty within the DT components by means of risk-based reliability frameworks. The research project answers the following questions:
The project contributes towards a safer and more reliable operation of MPOPs in both exposed high-energy offshore and nearshore environments.

Supply chain networks - Tas offshore blue economy,"This project focuses on the crucial contribution of supply chains and logistic activities for the offshore co-location of aquaculture and renewable energy.  Already, businesses are recognising the potential benefits of adopting a blue economy advantage by shifting seafood farming and production to offshore locations as evidenced by for example salmon farming and kelp harvesting. In addition, there is growing interest in offshore locations for the production of wind, tidal energy, and other sources of renewable energy.  Within this emerging context, there are the many challenges that will impact on traditional business practices in an offshore environment, including how these quite different industries can be co-located on shared multi-use platforms many kilometres from shore.
Moving these businesses offshore will also necessitate different approaches to addressing logistics challenges in remote environments in locations that may be at times unsafe and constantly changing.  Additionally, the supply chains in which the offshore aquaculture and renewable energy businesses operate, that may extend internationally, will be required to co-exist as supply chain networks if they are to gain the required efficiencies to remain viable.
This project will initially require an assessment of the range of aquaculture and renewable energy activities that can be undertaken offshore and in doing so, identify the various industry actors and stakeholders making up this new blue economy ecosystem. Another aspect of this research is evaluating potential alternative business models suitable for integrating offshore business practices within a unified supply chain network.  The validity of the findings from the literature review will then be tested by empirical research by collecting and analysing the views from the industry actors and stakeholders to identify opportunities, challenges and concerns to developing a viable and sustainable ecosystem in the blue economy. The outcomes of this project are expected to identify workable design options for sustainable blue economy operations and the associated management of the supply chain network. This project is directly aligned with Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) research milestones of RP5.2. The candidate will be able to interact with BE CRC researchers and industry partners through the project.

Maritime competency and knowledge transfer,"The shipping industry plays an important role in today’s global economy as it is a facilitation mechanism for more than 90% of world trade. However, in recent history thousands of incidents and accidents involving ships have resulted in loss of life and property, not to mention environmental damage of different magnitudes. It is estimated that over 80% of all maritime mishaps are presently attributable to the human element and onboard human actions. However, from early in their careers, mariners have to attend formal learning environments to gain skills and knowledge that they need to practice safely onboard ships. Yet little is known about how this learning is applied practically on the job, i.e. what is transferred from one setting to another and how this transfer occurs. Through the investigation of the mariners in their formal learning environment (marine colleges) and in their workplace (on board ships), it is the utmost purpose of the present ethnographic study to understand the implications of this discussion in reducing shipping accidents. The database will be composed of videotapes, field notes, interviews and documents. The implications of this study are relevant to workplace learning research in general and to maritime education and safe shipping practice in particular.

Maritime 4.0 and the role of future seafarers in autonomous shipping,"In recent years the advent of technology, especially in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), brings about the possibility of developing fully autonomous systems. Recently, with the introduction of commercially sensible solutions, design and operation of unmanned and autonomous cargo and passenger ships are gaining momentum. Soon this will persuade shipping companies to add autonomous ships to their fleet. Therefore, this research is timely as autonomous shipping is not a promise to be delivered in the future but a reality which has already commenced.
The utilisation of the autonomous and unmanned shipping technology will have many effects on seafaring and the role seafarers as operators should play. However, although these ships are referred to as unmanned, the human element will still be present as remote operators when ships with autonomous systems enter into service. The shore-based operations of such ships demand new skills and expertise that are yet unknown, thus requires an extensive investigation. Current literature emphasis on the uniqueness of requirement of training for operators who work in an automated space. Moreover, the current maritime training regulatory systems do not account for training needs of the future autonomous ship operators. Thus, there is a need for research to shed light on these essential skills.
Although the training gaps and possible expertise for autonomous ship operation have been recognised, it is yet unknown what exactly the international maritime education and training regime should do to ensure that the maritime workforce is ready to respond to the future demand. There is also a gap in addressing the role of the IMO, maritime administrations and maritime training institutions in that future. Hence, this research will answer the following questions:
This research will conduct an extensive investigation to identify the requirement of operation of autonomous ships in the near future and the skill and competency that the seafarers who will operate them needs to possess. The findings of this research will provide guidelines and a recommendary framework which can be used by the International and national maritime regulatory bodies to revise training needs towards mentoring seafarers and equipping them with the expertise required.

High-Pressure Diesel Spray,"Global concerns to reduce emissions are continuously forcing manufacturers to improve the efficiency of engines by optimising fuel injection systems and combustion process. Despite the wide use of injectors, the key physics of the fuel injection processes are not yet fully understood imposing a significant challenge for the development of more efficient injection system and combustion processes. The primary atomisation of the liquid fuel jet occurs in the region close to the nozzle exit, influences secondary atomisation, spray dynamics, air-fuel mixture quality, and ultimately the entire combustion process. Complex and concurrent physics associated with primary and secondary atomisation of liquid fuel induce more constraints for researchers to experimentally characterise the effect of phenomena such as swirl flow, flow separation, cavitation, and turbulence on spray dynamics.
These limitations can be tackled by the means of numerical modellings which provide a clearer understanding of spray dynamics involving transition from liquid jets to fine droplets. Numerical models which are used in the design of fuel injectors are subjected to further developments through the inclusion of recent research findings. Experimental tests conducted within the AMC's constant volume high-pressure spray chamber provide a qualitative and quantitative database to evaluate and validate numerical modelling results. The present work focuses on processes in the nozzle and the first several nozzle diameters after the nozzle exit of a single-hole solid cone injector.
High fidelity numerical models can be utilised to characterise detailed evolution of fuel spray from liquid jets to dispersed small scale droplets. The use of high-resolution numerical schemes and flux reconstruction algorithms can deal with highly turbulent flow phenomenon that occur with great variation in spatial and time scales. Highly accurate results predicted by the developed high-resolution numerical methods can act as an indispensable supplement to existing experimental observations and measurements which contribute to the optimisation/development of next generation low emission and high thermal efficiency combustion engines.

Industry 4.0 in maritime supply chain,"Industry 4.0 is a broad term used to refer to the fourth Industrial Revolution. It integrates the relationships between workers, systems, objects, and sections of an organization, supported by various applications such as the internet of things (IoT), cyber-physical systems (CPSs), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics (BDA). In recent years, digitisation, automation and advanced analytics are causing transformation in global competitions by enabling firms to manage their supply chain network (SCN). A global SCN consists of multiple interconnected buyers and suppliers of products or services who are located in different geographical areas. Using various applications of industry 4.0 can affect the way that buyers and suppliers interact by facilitating and integrating the processes and systems leading to better cooperation and communication with each other in a new intelligent way.
The substantial disruptions of the material flow in the global SCNs can result in significant losses that may threaten firm’s SCN. For example, the COVID-19 crisis has created short and long-term negative impacts on supply shortages and disrupting supply operations around the world. To reduce the negative effects of the disruptions, many firms have changed the way they interact with their SCN members. Particularly, the disruption has profound impacts on suppliers (regardless of their tiers), buyers, and how buyer-supplier relationships are governed in a maritime SCN. Maritime SCNs have been responsible for the vast majority of global trade and are becoming increasingly complex and dynamic. Therefore, maritime SCNs can be significantly vulnerable to disruptions.
Since digital technologies can have a positive impact on mitigating disruptions, many firms have decided to implement various industry 4.0 applications to manage their maritime SCN. This has transformed the relationship between buyers and suppliers within the maritime SCN. However, there is still a strong need to explore different aspects of industry 4.0 applications in managing the relationships within the maritime SCNs to mitigate the disruptions. Therefore, this project will address this issue by investigating the impact of industry 4.0 technologies on developing appropriate relationships between buyers and suppliers to mitigate maritime SCN disruptions.

Electricity Enhancement in Constructed Wetlands (CWs),"Australia has the sixth-longest coastline of any nation, with more than 85% of the population living within 50 km of the sea. Urbanisation, resource-extraction activities, and the need for greater agricultural outputs have already put significant pressure on our water supply, and impacts associated with climate change are beginning to emerge. As highlighted in a 2015 senate enquiry, Australia's urban area produces 3000 gigalitres of stormwater runoff annually. Contamination of coastal areas, water storages and oceans by polluted agriculture and stormwater runoff is a serious concern in Australia and worldwide. Declining coastal water quality, influenced by agricultural runoff, is recognised as one of the most significant threats to the Great Barrier Reef.
Constructed wetlands (CWs) are recognised as resilient, economical, and extensive decentralised eco-friendly technologies capable of meeting water treatment challenges. Until now electricity generation in Constructed Wetlands (CWs) integrated with Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) for coastal areas is very low. The improvement in electricity generation or electron flow to the conductive material can be applied for real time applications such as pollutant sensing. In addition, transfer of electron to conductive material can also enhance the treatment of wastewater in CW.  It is reported by several studies with bioelectrochemical cells such as MFC, a large fraction of electron transfers to the methanogenic bacteria for the production of methane gas. This is the reason why the production rate of methane gas is high in CW-MFC systems whereas electricity generation is low. In this project, we are trying to inhibit methanogenic bacteria so that the entire or maximum electron goes directly to the conductive material. With extracting more electrons from the microbes, electricity generation of CW-MFC can be enhanced. This strategy can also be beneficial for producing greenhouse gases of low potential.
So, the objectives of this PhD research are:

Machine learning path replanning for ASV,"Brief Description: Recently the autonomous surface vessels have been developed used the more and more widely in forms of autonomous ferries, fully-electrically operated propulsion vessels, and observation class autonomous surface boats. In order to increase their autonomy, many intelligent algorithms have been developed.
The project involves development of novel path planning/re-planning and guidance navigation control algorithm for an ASV with machine learning approach. A trend in machine learning algorithms has recently shown its smart and intelligent property to increase autonomy and adaptation of autonomous vehicles operating in dynamic changing environments, especially with moving obstacles. A smart and intelligent real-time path planning/replanning and control algorithm will be proposed by applying a machine learning method. The machine learning method to be selected will be the most applicable in autonomous surface vessel for a full mission, such as lawn mowing survey pattern with sampling, search and rescue mission, or object collision avoidance control mission. Once the proposed algorithm has been formulated it will be verified and validate by both numerical simulation and field experiments in real-world conditions using a model scaled surface vessel with good manoeuvrability.
Purposes and Targets: The main purpose is to solve the problem of online real-time implementation of complete coverage path replanning and trajectory tracking control of ASVs due to the changing environments and obstacles existing in the transections of mission, especially the moving obstacles like surrounding boats and vessels. The target is to formulate the proposed algorithm, and then verify and validate it by both numerical simulation and field experiments using a real-world ASV under real-world changing environment.

Machine learning based path replanning,"The applications of AUVs are wider and wider in terms of depth range and dynamic environments, especially under-ice missions, thus require increased autonomy and smart replanning and control algorithms. This project involves developing machine learning based algorithms for complete coverage and path replanning and control of AUVs with numerical simulation and field experiments. Current trend does not show that many intelligent replanning and control algorithms could be verified and validated on real-world AUVs under dynamic changing / challenging underwater environments, especially the effects of unmeasurable ocean currents and in-observable underwater obstacles.

The nutrition of cannibalism,"The prevalence of cannibalistic behaviours is recognized as one of the most significant limiting factors in the culture productivity of many commercially important crustaceans, including that for spiny lobsters. Cannibalism among crustaceans is a complex behaviour involving various biotic and abiotic factors including availability of refuge, social hierarchies, nutritional resources, and communication pathways. This project will focus on nutritional components associated with cannibalism with the aim of defining its contrition to growth in aquaculture and for developing mitigation strategies to limit its impact on culture productivity. Recent research at IMAS has shown that cannibalism during spiny lobster ""P. ornatus"" culture occurs as an act of aggression resulting in the killing and consumption of the victim when vulnerable during the process of ecdysis (moulting). The occurrence of cannibalism consistently occurs as a factor of moulting frequency resulting in increased occurrence in fastest-growing populations. Importantly, findings also suggest that cannibalism events are pre-determined and likely triggered by water-borne chemical cues released by the victim during the process of moult preparation and ecdysis. This project will first focus on the conundrum relating to the relationship between growth rate and cannibalism to disentangle the influence of con-specific nutrient intake on lobster growth performance. This research will involve in-depth nutritional and biochemical analysis with the aim of identifying gross- or micro-nutrient deficiencies which may drive the need for cannibalism. The project will then consider the impacts of feed supplementations with the aim of limiting cannibalism. This research may consider several avenues of investigation including; supplementation of potential limiting nutrients, dietary additives that may act as antagonists to chemical cues of cannibalism, and neurotransmitter precursors that may suppress aggressive behaviours.

Effect of rudder deflection on vessel dynamic heel,"Global demand for efficient sea transportation has led to the evolution of large vessels worldwide. To capitalise in this efficiency increase, these larger vessels must manoeuvre in ever more confined waterways. Operating in such confined waterways creates unsafe transit for channel shipping. Additionally, extreme drought condition has led to the low water level in rivers and consequently has interrupted transportation not only by larger vessels but also by the current vessels which could safely passed through the rivers in the past. To provide safe transits, all possible vertical motions and draught changes should be considered. One of the sources of the draught change is the dynamic heel due to rudder deflection. Operating in the rivers requires to remain in the provided safe course and vessels’ rudders are continuously in motion for course keeping purposes.
When a body moves in a circular path, there is a force towards the centre called centripetal force. In the case of a ship turning in a circle, the centripetal force is produced by the water acting on the side of the ship away from the centre of the turn. For equilibrium, there must be an equal and opposite force, which acts at the centre of mass (G). When a ship's rudder turns to port, the forces on the rudder itself causes a small angle of heel initially to port, however, the underwater form of the ship and centrifugal force on it cause a final static heel to starboard, and vice versa.
These two forces are coupled which tends to heel the ship away from the centre of the turn. Although a dynamic heel is developed during this coupling, the final static heel is usually taken into consideration. Neglecting dynamic heel is acceptable in waves due to the small ratio of this motion to the roll motion. However, in the case of calm water, particularly in rivers, canals and ports where there is restriction in terms of width and depth, the dynamic heel plays an important role.
This research project aims to investigate the effect of rudder deflection on the vessel’s dynamic heel by three different methods of experimental, numerical and analytically solving equations of motion.

The impact of Antarctic sea ice on simulated Southern Ocean watermasses,"Despite being only 6% of the global ocean’s surface area, the Southern Ocean dominates the ocean’s absorption of anthropogenic heat and carbon (Frolicher et al., 2015), with critical implications for the planet’s response to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Absorbing this heat and carbon, and locking it away in the deep ocean, relies on a complex interplay of wind and buoyancy forcing that drives exchanges of sea water between the surface and deep ocean, that is poorly understood. There is strong evidence that Antarctic sea ice is an important factor in this process, by forcing surface salinity changes in the polar Southern Ocean (Abernathey et al., 2016, Haumann et al., 2016).
How well these processes are represented in coupled climate models, such as those used by the IPCC, and how that impacts global climate projections has not been explored. We do know, however, that climate models show a wide spread in how they represent Antarctic sea ice process (Schroeter et al., 2018) and Southern Ocean watermasses (Sallee et al., 2013).
In this project, the student will explore how Antarctic sea ice, and in particular its role in transporting fresh water from the Antarctic coastline to the open ocean, affects how well climate models in the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) represent the major Southern Ocean water masses. Furthermore, the student will quantify how this relates to simulated ocean heat and carbon uptake under current and future climate conditions, and the resulting implications for global climate sensitivity.

Robust estimates of Antarctic ice sheet melt,"Ocean-driven Antarctic mass loss is a large source of uncertainty in future sea level rise. To date, there has been no broad-scale comparison and evaluation of mass loss predictions from ocean-ice sheet interaction models. This project will analyse data from a range of circum-Antarctic ocean models, assessing their performance in matching observed ice-shelf melt rates over a range of spatial and temporal scales, with a first focus on the Amery Ice Shelf that has been substantial Australian-based focus of research over the last two decades. This project will contribute to the WCRP-supported Realistic Ice-sheet/Ocean State Estimates (RISE) project.
This PhD project will build on initial data collation and analysis undertaken under RISE by an AAPP postdoc. Beyond simply examining where models agree and disagree, this project will:
The candidate will develop skills in data handling, spatial and statistical analysis. A successful completion will improve our ability to assess the models used to predict future sea level rise.

Reef fish population dynamics,"Reef fishes support some of the most productive commercial fishing operations within the Tasmanian Scalefish Fishery (TSF). The three most important target species are Banded Morwong (Cheilodactylus spectabilis), Bluethroat Wrasse (Notolabrus tetricus) and Purple Wrasse (Notolabrus fucicola), with a combined annual commercial catch of approximately 120 tonnes over recent years. Populations of all three species are assumed to be sustainably fished. However, uncertainty remains about (1) the extent of potential localised population depletion, and (2) the exchange of individuals between heavily and lightly fished areas, which together has raised concerns over the long-term sustainability of local fishing operations. Better knowledge on small-scale reef fish population dynamics is of fundamental importance to the management of the commercial fisheries sector, given that current large-scale assessments of trends in catch, effort and catch rates are insensitive to potential changes in abundance at the level of individual reefs, which is the putative scale at which the fishery impacts populations. Moreover, there is a lack of empirical data to determine the appropriate structure and parameterisation of current stock assessment models to represent fish population biomass and exchange across shallow and deeper-water (>30 m) reef habitats. Thus, better knowledge on the severity of localised population depletion and on the distribution of individuals across reefs and depth gradients have been flagged as research priorities of high importance to the TSF. This PhD project aims to address these research priorities by collating all existing data from various projects on Tasmanian reef fishes, mapping and characterising reef habitats across state waters, and initiating targeted field surveys on the distribution of reef fishes across identified gradients in environmental condition and fishing intensity. The project will thereby help improve the accuracy of and confidence in stock assessments. It will further help to inform options for future reef fish monitoring.

Liner Shipping Resilience,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the dependence of communities on efficient supply chains for societal well-being, health and prosperity. Communities remain vulnerable to disruptions in supply of food, medicine and other goods necessary for the functioning of healthy economies. By transporting all manner of goods from everyday essential items to industrial materials, liner shipping performs a key role in enabling communities and economies to function. Community resilience is therefore intricately linked to the resilience of liner shipping companies in being able to provide efficient transport services in the face of disruptions.
Covid-19 is challenging the way liner shipping operates. Supply chains are reorganising as countries scramble to reduce their dependence on one source of supply (e.g. China). Health protection measures e.g. social distancing and safety measures coupled with new regulations are impacting logistics and transport operations in new ways. Navigating around and through the COVID-19 situation has left liner shipping companies in uncharted waters with blank sailings becoming the norm for many operators. In the highly competitive global shipping environment, liner shipping companies must therefore formulate relevant strategies to remain competitive and sustainable in challenging times.
This project aims to investigate the resilience of liner shipping companies when confronted by COVID-19 related disruptions and to draw lessons for the post-COVID-19 era. Specifically, the project will investigate:

Predicting species size-distributions,"Natural populations consist of individuals that at any given time vary in their body size. The shape of body size distribution in a population can inform us about population status and species properties, but most analyses to date are based on theoretical predictions without extensive validations with empirical data. Many size-based ecological and fisheries models assume that the maximum body size of a species is fixed in space and time, yet empirical data suggests that species body sizes vary extensively across temperature gradients. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that that intra-specific body size distributions could be described with a consistent shape, but conditions under which this occurs remain unclear. This project aims to investigate statistical properties of intra-specific body size distributions in fishes and other aquatic ectotherms using a extensive global and regional empirical datasets across ecological and human impact gradients (underwater visual surveys, fisheries surveys, citizen science, angler reports, and others).
The project has three main objectives:
1) Identify and quantify intra-specific body-size distributions using empirical datasets of fishes and aquatic invertebrates (copepods, rotifers) that span ecological and harvesting gradients. Assess whether temperature and harvesting induce consistent responses in the properties of size-distributions (e.g., mean, variance, skew).
2) Conduct population and community-level simulations to explore species physiological parameters and ecological conditions under which theoretically predicted size distributions are consistent with empirically observed distributions, assessed in objective 1.
3) Develop quantitative tools that take observed body-size distributions when the number of observations is limited and estimate population status. Apply the tools to citizen science-based data sets (e.g., angler data, natural history observations) that are becoming increasingly abundant with advances in detection and monitoring technology.

Reconstructing the input of bioavailable iron to Antarctic waters,"The input and dissolution of continental material to high nutrient surface waters of the Southern Ocean plays an important role in biogeochemical cycling of carbon because it alleviates iron limitation and stimulates phytoplankton growth. Close to Antarctica, dissolved iron sources include melting sea ice, icebergs calved from glaciers, and upwelled deep waters. The Antarctic Ice Sheet is experiencing rapid changes in response to anthropogenic climate warming. Melting ice shelves and glacier retreat will increase the input of freshwater and dissolved continental material to the surface ocean, but the biological response to these changes (and therefore impact on the global carbon cycle) is unknown. However, we can study the biological and chemical response to past changes in ice sheet retreat recorded in ocean sediments to improve our understanding of how the system might change in the future. The focus of this PhD project is to quantify the dissolved iron flux along the continental margin of East Antarctica in modern and past climate states.
A major focus of this project will be to evaluate the performance of a sediment proxy for dissolved iron input. This method, based on the relative abundance of Th-232 and Th-230 in sediment leaches, was proposed by Robinson et al (2008), but has not been tested in polar regions. Thorium is very insoluble in seawater and as it dissolves from continental material it rapidly adsorbs to the surface of particles, making it an excellent tracer of dissolved components. The leaching is designed to recover only the Th that is adsorbed to the sediment particles, which should represent the 232Th/230Th ratio in the overlying seawater. The 232Th/230Th ratio of seawater, in turn, reflects the input of dissolved lithogenic material, and should track dissolved Fe input. The student will use a suite of water column and surface sediment samples collected from Cape Darnley, East Antarctica, to evaluate the 232Th/230Th proxy method.

Managing supply chains under disruptions,"In the recent decades, there have been growing numbers of large-scale disruptions caused by natural disasters, trade wars and pandemics. Due to the increasing interdependency of participants in supply chain (SC) networks, disruptions to any part of the SC will inevitably affect others in the same SC network causing adverse impacts on business continuity and performance. Accordingly, a decision made in one part of the SC to respond to disruptions may affect the entire network it belongs to. Current decision tools have two major shortcomings, one being the disintegration of decision-making leading to suboptimal solutions in terms of cost, efficiency and quality, and the other being the assumption that decisions can be made with certainty. The project aims to solve three key research questions: 1) what and how disruptions may affect SMEs in the Australian agri-food supply chains? 2) what are the challenges faced by SMEs when making decisions under supply chain disruptions? And 3) how can decisions be made to prepare for and respond to disruptions under uncertain environments?  To provide practical tools, the project aims to develop models for integrated decision-making under uncertainties. The outcomes of the project will contribute to improving the resilience of Australian agri-food supply chains.

Blockchain-based bills of lading,"Shipping companies have been introducing blockchain-based bills of lading for their businesses. However, the legal status of these remains unclear since the laws relating to carriage documents were developed between the 18th and the 19th centuries. The International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading, Brussels, 25th August 1924 (The ""Hague Rules""), along with its protocols in 1968 and 1979 (The ""Hague-Visby Rules"") were developed during the period when no one would envisage even the development of desktop computers. While the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea, 11 December 2008 (The ""Rotterdam Rules) contains some provisions on the electronic transport records but this international convention is unlikely to come into force. Earlier in 2021, the English Law Commission launched a consultation with an aim to formulate a statute on electronic trade documents. In Australia, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991 (Cth) contains an ""Amended Hague Rules"" as the Schedule in which a term ""sea carriage document"" has been defined to encompass electronic bills of lading. Same is true for the Sea-Carriage Documents Act of different States and Territories in Australia where there are provisions on ""electronic and computerised sea-carriage documents"". However, to what extent these statutory provisions are applicable to blockchain-based bills of lading remain doubtful. The purpose of this research is to offer critiques of the current legal regimes on carriage documents and identify why they are insufficient to accommodate the use of the blockchain-based bills of lading. It will then seek to reformulate a suitable legal regime regulating the use of these documents in view to propose a new statutory regime.

Modelling the Great Southern Reef,"The Great Southern Reef (GSR) is an interconnected temperate marine system fringing more than 8,000 km of Australia's southern coastline and encapsulates nearly all the nation's major population centres from the Queensland/ New South Wales border, Victoria, around Tasmania and across South Australia to its sub-tropical limit in Western Australia. While the importance of this system is increasingly recognised, its interconnectedness remains largely unexplored. By applying meta-community modelling approaches (initially developed for the Great Barrier Reef), this PhD project will explore the connectedness of the Great Southern Reef and model the interplay of climate change, reef-based fisheries, protected species, and offshore infrastructure on its dynamics.

The development of a biological control health management strategy to prevent white leg disease (WLD) in the tropical rock lobster (TRL) Panulirus ornatus,"Despite relatively few diseases having been reported in the culture of tropical rock lobster (TRL) one colloquially termed white leg disease (WLD) has emerged as a recurring and potentially devastating health problem often resulting in significant losses of larval TRL. Research at IMAS has identified the aetiological agent of WLD as Aquimarina sp. TRL1 while health strategies to mitigate the threat posed by WLD are yet to be developed.Biosecurity is an essential aspect of this emerging aquaculture industry. To ensure the sustainability of lobster aquaculture the use of living organisms or natural substances that prevent or reduce damage caused by harmful organisms otherwise known as biological control or biocontrol is preferred to traditional antibiotic treatment and potentially hazardous chemicals. Bacteriophages are viruses that only infect bacteria and are one of the most promising biocontrol agents. Predatory bacteria such as Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs) are Gram-negative, obligate predators of other Gram-negative bacteria and like phages are potential biocontrol agents.  Research into biocontrol to treat and or prevent WLD will form the basis of a PhD project and focus on the use of bacteriophages, and predatory bacteria (BALOs) as a health management strategy to prevent WLD.

Modelling downward carbon flux in the Southern Ocean: linking ocean midwater ecology and biogeochemistry,"The oceans act as major sinks of atmospheric carbon. The biological pump is the ocean’s biologically driven carbon sequestration system. It has several key pathways for sequestering carbon (e.g., gravitational pump and particle injection via diverse groups of midwater biota), however, understanding these pathways and their interactions is not easy and therefore has seldom been attempted. Often the models designed to quantify downward particulate carbon flux in the oceans lack information on key pathways and their parameterization may only focus on a limited number of these conduits. Development of a holistic model which links these ecological and biogeochemical pathways will provide a much more comprehensive and accurate picture of downward particulate carbon flux across the oceans. Such a model will enable researchers to track the oceans’ ongoing ability to sequester carbon in response to climate change.

Big data-driven ship route planning,"In the fragile global supply chain post-pandemic, reduction in bunker fuel consumption is critical to reduce the global supply chain cost because ships transport more than 90% of international trade cargoes and bunker fuel accounts for a significant portion of operating costs of a ship. Safety of ships and their cargoes are also paramount for global supply chain. In the operational level, these two factors are addressed by deck officers on a daily basis through ship route planning.
This project aims to develop ship route planning models and algorithms driven by a big set of data, including weather archive and forecast data (swell, waves, sea currents, wind) and ship energy consumption recorded data. The proposed models and algorithms will factor in a ship’s dynamic stability requirements in different weather/sea conditions as well as the target of reducing bunker fuel consumption and mitigating ship emissions. To enhance the industry applications, the project also aims to develop novel computerised models and algorithms by integrating the weather forecast data and websites widely-used by seafarers. Safety of ships in terms of dynamic stability, ship energy efficiency, and emissions are the core considerations of the models and the theoretical innovations, while the computerisation of models and algorithm will automate the process of deck officers’ ship route planning. Dynamic stability will focus on the operational limitations posed by Second Generation of Intact Stability Criteria (SGISC), and ship energy efficiency will be quantified by machine learning models.

Micro-nutrient requirements of juvenile tropical (Panulirus ornatus) with reference to requirements at moulting,"This PhD will aim to quantify mineralisation of the exoskeleton of juvenile tropical as a function of endogenous (stored) and exogeneous (food and environment) mineral sources. Mineral fluxes in crustaceans around moulting signifies specific physiological adaptations particularly aimed at maintaining the acid-base homeostasis. At the pre-moult stage, minerals are resorbed from the old cuticle and at post-moult stage, the new cuticle is mineralised.  Crustacea have some specific mechanisms to store resorbed minerals, particularly calcium from the old cuticle and which is made available to mineralise the new cuticle at post-moult. However, this endogenous source of mineral is not considered significant in marine crustacea due to it being readily available in the environment. Therefore, it is generally accepted that food and the environment are the main source for minerals in marine crustacea and the relative importance of these two sources are species dependent. At present, the ability for juvenile tropical to store and reutilise resorbed minerals is unknown. Similarly, the relative contributions of minerals from food and the environment is as well unknown. A quantitative assessment of the three potential mineral sources (stored, food and environment) which makes up the exoskeleton is key to feed formulation. The PhD will employ a wide range of analytical tools to further understanding of the mechanism by which the acid-base balance in juvenile tropical is maintained.

Pin bone abnormalities in King salmon,"Poor skeletal health can pose a serious risk to the expected expansion of salmonids aquaculture into offshore and high energy farming environments which require fish with a robust skeletal system. Apart from impacting on welfare and performance of fish, skeletal abnormalities impact on final product processing efficiency and lead to an increase in downgrades. New Zealand king salmon has been historically impacted by spinal curvature in their stock, and in the past two years there has been an emerging issue with intermuscular bones abnormalities (commonly referred to as ""pin bones""). These two issues indicate poor skeletal health in some fish stocks, and this is likely to become exacerbated by increased musculoskeletal challenge as seen in offshore environments. The goal of this project is to better understand pin bone development and abnormalities (and their link with spinal curvature) observed in king salmon as a reasonable proxy for assessing overall skeletal health.
The project consists of five main steps:

Giant crab's dietary analysis as a proxy,"It is estimated that exploitable biomass of the giant crab has declined from a maximum of approximately 1500 tonnes in the early 1990's to 244 tonnes in 2009/10, equating to 16% of the original unﬁshed exploitable biomass (Hartman and Gardner 2011). Total biomass and egg production have also decreased to 19% of their initial levels. The reasons for decline of stock levels could be diverse ranging from overfishing to habitat loss associated with damaging fishing practices such as deep-water trawling.  There is a clear concern about this stock and viability of its fishery. Therefore, a better understanding of habitat diversity, prey availability, stock structure and decoupling of fishery drivers are necessary to guide and sustainably manage the ﬁshery into the future.
The project will combine morphological, observational and molecular approaches to analyse the faeces content of the giant crab as a proxy to infer dietary diversity of the species that may be diagnostic to fishing grounds along the East and West coasts of Tasmania. Specifically, the project will;

Standing meanders in the Southern Ocean,"Changes in the Southern Ocean are substantial and widespread (Bindoff, Cheung et al. 2019) and different to other regions (Meredith, et al 2019). In particular the winds have strengthened, water masses have changed, and oxygen has declined.  New dynamical understanding and observations have shown that there are several hotspots of high poleward heat transport from eddies towards Antarctica (Foppert et al, 2017). These hot spots of eddy driven poleward heat flux are associated with standing meanders tied to large bathymetric features (Thompson and Naviera-Garabato, 2014).  The observed increase in kinetic energy (and poleward heat flux) is in contrast to the fact that the transport of the ACC has remained almost constant (Hogg et al, 2014).
While standing meanders occur in the vicinity of large bathymetric features, the dynamics controlling the length, amplitude, and variability of these meanders remains largely unknown. The circulation associated with standing meanders plays an important role in determining the strength and transient response of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and the ventilation of fluid in the abyssal ocean and poleward heat transport (Thompson and Naviera-Garabato, 2014). Given the crucial role played by standing meanders and related circulations it is now urgent that we understand how these meanders will respond to changing winds and surface buoyancy forcing, at weather and climate time scales.
The significance of this project relates to the role of standing meanders as a focus for changing poleward transports of heat and the how this heat transport could accelerate with changing climate, with consequences for the redistribution of heat within the polar gyres and the future melt of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.  The response time of meanders to changes in surface forcing has widely ranging estimates (eg Armour et al, 2017) and new estimates of response time is a key outcome of this project.

Fish sizes and growth in a warming ocean,"Climate change and fishing is causing rapid changes in body sizes of many fish species. These changes are driven by multiple physiological and ecological processes, such as food availability, growth, reproduction, mortality and species redistributions. A recent study by UTAS researchers showed that in Tasmanian rocky reefs, average body lengths for many fish species are changing by 0.5-1% per year (Figure). The associated impacts of such fish body size changes on coastal fish communities and ecosystem functioning are likely to be significant, and implications for fisheries management and conservation remain largely unexplored.
This project will build on extensive IMAS and CSIRO research expertise in fish size ecology, fisheries, coastal ecosystems function and marine conservation. It will explore drivers and consequences of body size changes in coastal Tasmanian fish species using long-term underwater visual survey data, fisheries surveys, historical records, existing and new fish growth data, and physiologically structured size-based ecosystem models for Tasmanian rocky reefs.

Emerging marine heatwave stress-scapes,"Marine heatwaves, or periods of prolonged warm ocean temperature extremes, can have devastating impacts on marine ecosystems (e.g. Garrabou et al. 2009; Wernberg et al. 2013). For instance, the 2015/16 Tasman Sea marine heatwave triggered disease and mortality in oysters and abalone (Oliver et al. 2017), and the 2011 marine heatwave off Western Australia caused substantial dieback of kelp and seagrass (Wernberg et al. 2013; Arias-Ortiz et al. 2018), but also impacted corals and invertebrate species (Caputi et al. 2016). As ocean temperatures rise under global warming, marine heatwaves are increasing in their intensity, duration, and frequency (Oliver et al., 2018).
Part of the challenge of adaptation planning and managing risks for marine stakeholders (e.g. Holbrook et al. 2020) is a lack of access to clear, reliable, and locally applicable marine heatwave hazard or risk information (e.g. Kajtar et al. 2021; Kajtar and Holbrook 2021). Confounding the projections to extreme temperatures are changes to other variables, such as wind speeds and direction, salinity, wave height, and dissolved oxygen. Some of these changes may offset the impacts from amplified marine heatwaves, but others may exacerbate the impacts. Therefore, analysing multiple variables together to understand the changing ""stress-scape"" is crucial (Blaisdell et al. 2021).

Downscaling of Australian marine climate,"As with most of planet Earth, ocean temperatures around Australia have been increasing under global warming. Associated with this ocean warming, the intensity, duration, and frequency of marine heatwaves – periods of prolonged, warm ocean temperature extremes – have also increased (Oliver et al., 2018). Much effort has focussed on understanding changes in the average state of the offshore warming and their forcing mechanisms (e.g., Cai et al. 2005, Cai 2006, Sun et al. 2012, Oliver and Holbrook 2014). However, comprehensive investigations of the coastal effects of this warming, and how this affects ocean temperature extremes, have been limited due to the paucity of coastal oceanographic observations and the absence of high-resolution model data across the continental shelf. In particular, understanding the impact of global warming on coastal marine heatwaves is of great importance.
High-resolution predictions of ocean variability on Australia's continental shelf are essential for characterising how the complex near-coastal marine climate (e.g., circulation, temperature, salinity) and ecology will change in the coming decades.  Existing observations are too sparse in time and space to adequately characterise the relevant coastal oceanographic processes. Some regions (e.g. the coasts of South Australia, New South Wales, and the Great Barrier Reef) have employed high-resolution regional models to address this limitation through dynamical downscaling, but for other regions such downscaling or regional modelling is lacking.

Deriving accurate sea-ice (and snow) thickness near-real time estimates for the East Antarctic region,"The seasonal evolution of the ocean-atmosphere exchange at the surface of the Southern Ocean gives rise to the formation, advection, deformation and melt of Antarctic sea ice. While  observations are scarce, the existing measurements revealed substantial spatio-temporal variability in ice concentration and also ice thickness. Much of our information is based on passive-microwave derived two-dimensional measurements of the ice cover. More recently laser and radar altimetry have been supported on polar-orbiting satellites, opening possibilities to translate those into sea-ice freeboard and finally ice thickness.

CCAMLR: Harbinger of Change in the the ATS?,"The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CAMLR Convention) was concluded in 1980 and entered into force in 1982 as an integral part of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). The CAMLR Convention established and established a precautionary, science-focused, ecosystem-based approach to management of marine living resources in the Southern Ocean to be administered by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). CCAMLR is embedded within the ATS, but is also free standing, with decision-making procedures and actions independent from the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.
In its first three decades (1982-2011) CCAMR was a leader in marine resource conservation. In addition to its innovative commitment to a science-based, precautionary, ecosystem-based approach to management, CCAMLR pioneered work on “illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, incidental mortality of seabirds associated with fishing activity, and in the designation and management of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs)”. CCAMLR was also an early adopter of the performance review mechanism and established the world’s first high seas marine protected areas (MPA). The decade 2011-2021 has seen CCAMLR’s core principles and norms being challenged, with increased breakdown in consensus. This project focuses on the extent to which CCAMLR is a harbinger of coming stresses on the ATS.
This project will utilise a qualitative social science multiple-methods approach, including content analysis of policy documents and international treaties and semi-structured interviews with scientists and policy makers following approval from the University of Tasmania Human Research Ethics Committee. It will also utilise proximity to the CCAMLR secretariat in Hobart and access to the Antarctic Treaty Documents Database at the University of Tasmania.

The stability of Larsen C Ice Shelf,"Modelled projections of the contribution of the Antarctic ice sheets to sea level rise over this century vary from a few centimetres to more than one metre, a huge uncertainty grounded in poor understanding of ice shelves, the ice-sheet’s floating extensions that constrain its flow from the interior to the ocean. Half of the Antarctic coastline is fringed by such shelves, and many are vulnerable to climate-driven retreat, with some already disintegrated such as Larsen B, Antarctic Peninsula. The latter’s final demise triggered a multi-fold acceleration of its former tributary glaciers that persists to the present day, clearly demonstrating the fundamental role that ice-shelf buttressing plays in regulating sea level rise. The processes driving and resisting ice-shelf retreat are still not well understood, however, including most importantly ice fracture and rift propagation that disrupt the normal assumptions of continuity inherent in ice sheet models and are highly dependent on the heterogeneous nature of ice shelves.
The project “Rift Propagation for Ice Sheet Models” (RIP-ICE), funded by the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council and led by the co-supervisors, will collect new field and satellite data to quantify heterogeneity and develop a fracture physics approach to simulate rift propagation through the Larsen C Ice Shelf, Larsen B’s southern neighbour increasingly affected by climate warming. This PhD project will use cutting-edge quantitative techniques to analyse and model both new ground-penetrating radar, seismic and electromagnetic geophysical data to be collected by RIP-ICE on the Larsen C Ice Shelf in the 2022/23 season, and comprehensive existing geophysical data sets collected in three previous field seasons. Mapping and quantifying the ice-shelf’s internal heterogeneity, including the effects of melting and refreezing that are now prolific throughout much of the year, this PhD project will therefore provide important boundary constraints for the new-generation ice-sheet model developed by RIP-ICE.

Bull Kelp aquaculture,"There is a significant opportunity for the expansion of the seaweed industry in Australia. Within the Blue Economy CRC, bull kelp (Durvillaea spp.) is a strong option for off-shore cultivation due to its ability to tolerate high wave energy and produce alginates at high levels. However, basic biological information required for cultivation (reproduction and growth, hatchery methods and grow-out requirements) are not known for bull kelp which represents a significant knowledge gap for the industry.
This PhD project aims to generate this critical information to kick-start the cultivation of bull kelp as part of the emerging Tasmanian seaweed industry. The project will first, develop an understanding of the reproductive and early life-cycle biology of bull kelp which will lead into optimisation of hatchery methods. Following this, the optimal season and tissue to harvest for maximum alginate production will be determined. Finally, the project will trial out-planting methods for at-sea cultivation of bull kelp.

Autonomous technologies for aquaculture,"Aquaculture will increasingly require both routine and event-driven environmental monitoring. Autonomous systems will play an enabling role in these operations, fundamentally improving sustainability at existing sites and the assessment of new sites. The move to complex offshore environments envisaged by the Blue Economy CRC will benefit directly from improved methodologies for advancing remote/autonomous systems. This project will develop new methodologies utilising autonomous sensor networks and platforms to enhance the management of oyster farming sites The outcomes of this project will provide a robust foundation for examining the potential of new inshore aquaculture sites and the next level of challenges when production is moved offshore.
Autonomous systems are the future of ocean operations and will become central tools in enabling the growth and success of the Blue Economy. The reduction of risk to operations by advanced warning of changing environmental conditions - in, around and downstream of an aquaculture site - are key drivers of this trend.
The project will focus on six key objectives:

Benchmarking Atlantic Salmon Performance,"Tasmania is increasingly impacted by climate change and ahead of global trends 1,2 which poses a risk to the Tasmanian Atlantic salmon industry as well as the global industry.  Climate change will impact on two critical environmental factors on which Atlantic salmon, and fish in general, rely on to survive and perform, temperature and dissolved oxygen 2,3. The main impact will consist of an increased frequency of both short- and long-term fluctuations in these two factors which will likely exceed both the optimal physiological range and the tolerance limit of the species 3–6.
Therefore, given the need to further expand our knowledge on the effect of both temperature and dissolved oxygen on Atlantic salmon, in particular under Tasmanian conditions, and given the value of the local industry for Australia sustainable seafood production, the research planned for this PhD project will mimic local environmental conditions and employ fish part of the Tasmanian industry lead Selective Breeding Program (SBP) at two different sizes. The project will access a number of genetic lines (i.e. families) which have been selected over the years based on their performance, and other commercial relevant traits, to thrive in Tasmanian conditions and that will continue to be selected to adapt to a rapidly changing climate.
The main aim is to further investigate and better understand the effect of changes in both temperature and oxygen on performance and ""omes"" (i.e. metabolome and proteome) of Tasmania Atlantic salmon as well as verify the genetic response and compare it to that observed in commercial settings to inform the industry on future strategies for selective breeding. The same conditions will be tested at two different sizes over two consecutive experiments to also understand how size interacts with those environmental variables. In fact, in a near future with the expansion into new production sites, including ones offshore, strategic planning around most suitable size for different sites based on their own localised environmental conditions will become essential.
The final major aim, deriving from the use of SBP fish and data comparison between different environments where these are reared, is to translate EAF-based research to commercial settings in the fastest possible way and validate the use of EAF as a ""tool"" to obtain meaningful answers to commercially relevant issues and which would not be possible to achieve at a commercial scale. The validation of EAF as ""translation tool"" will also lay the foundations for IMAS to further support the industry via the capability to test conditions which are likely to occur as part of climate change (e.g. longer periods of elevated sub-optimal temperatures and more frequent low DO events) but which would be impossible to test in commercial settings as not occurring yet. This will eventually inform on how the Tasmanian stocks will react and the type of response produced at multiple biological levels which will be extremely informative for the industry, in particular for targeted selective breeding.
The PhD will be aligned with a Blue Economy CRC project (2022-2025) that is led by IMAS and includes salmon industry partners. The research will be conducted at the world class EAF facility for conducting commercially relevant salmonid research on these themes and will build on IMAS procedures, experience and expertise 7–9. Furthermore, critical support from the Tasmania industry lead Selective Breeding Program (SBP) will be provided given their direct interest in the outcome of the trials and the development of EAF into a ""translation tool"".

Can kelp forests adapt and mitigate climate stressors?,"Kelps are the dominant species on Australia’s Great Southern Reef. With the growing threats from climate change, it’s important to assess the environmental resilience of kelp forests to increasing storminess; their ability to improve the health, society, and wellbeing of coastal communities by protecting against coastal erosion and ocean acidification; and the importance of these ecosystem services to local communities.
This project will use a transdisciplinary approach and novel sensor technologies to test the ability of kelp forests to adapt and mitigate climate stressors. The results will provide new insights into the role of natural kelp forests in coastal management.

Genomics of phytoplankton microbiomes,"Microbiome bacteria living on or near phytoplankton cells – in the phycosphere - are critical for phytoplankton health and maintaining primary production in the ocean.  Preliminary research on these bacteria indicate that they possess a range of surprising adaptations compared to their free-living marine relatives. Examples include biosynthesis of novel signalling molecules, growth stimulators and phytohormones, and apparent loss of entire pathways normally considered to be core metabolic functions.  This project aims to combine flow cytometry with novel culture and culture independent approaches to capture, sequence and assemble complete genomes of phytoplankton microbiome bacteria from natural phytplankton blooms. Using comparative genomics approaches and curated microbiome databases, the project aims to identify genomic and functional adaptation of bacteria to phycosphere micro-environments that are critical to their interaction with phytoplankton host cells, and to primary production in the ocean.

Community assembly of plankton microbiomes,"Like humans, microalgae and other plankton rely on bacteria – their unique microbiomes. Metabolically active microbiomes are essential for primary production in the ocean and contribute to development of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Imbalanced or depleted microbiomes can substantially alter the way plankton respond to environmental change, lead to disease and/or death of the host plankton cell, or modify production of marine biotoxins that poison humans of marine animals. Plankton cell microbiomes differ substantially from the background seawater microbial community, but how they are selectively recruited, and the principles governing community assembly remain unknown. This project aims to examine key parameters governing recruitment and development of phylogenetic and functional diversity of phytoplankton microbiomes using synthetic microbiome models, microbiome recruitment experiments, and microbial community profiling using high-throughput DNA sequencing.

Analysing Ecological Change in the Southern Ocean,"The Southern Ocean represents 20% of the world’s oceans. It is unquestionable that the Southern Ocean has changed over the past 30 years with warming waters, changing currents, changes in fisheries management and illegal fishing. Furthermore, climate predictions suggest further drastic changes into the future. How these historical changes have influenced the ecology of the Southern Ocean is relatively unknown and research to date has focused on a few well-known species. Future predictions also tend to be limited to a few select species. Understanding how a species assemblage has changed through time and space is important to improving ecosystem and fisheries management.
Species distribution models (SDM) are often used model changes, historical or future predictions, in a species distribution or abundance through time. There are many SDM modelling approaches including single species and mutli-species models. Developments in statistical modelling and increased access and knowledge of coding as increased our abilities to run complex models. However, there is a lack of knowledge of what approach is best at detecting different types of change. This is particularly important as very small changes in variables such as water temperatures could have a significant influence of the distribution and abundance of an assemblage. It is likely that some modelling approaches will be more sensitive in detecting small changes while minimizing model uncertainty.
Model uncertainty is often overlooked in the presentation of SDMs. Model uncertainty is also difficult to explain to stakeholders and managers as it difficult to incorporate levels of uncertainty into management actions. Yet, in sensitive ecosystems such as the Southern Ocean reporting and understanding model uncertainty is crucial.
This project will provide an opportunity to better understand how different approaches to SDMs can detect changes in the Southern Ocean and better understand the uncertainty associated with these approaches. It will also look at ways to communicate complex model results and uncertainty to managers. This provides stakeholder and managers with the best available information to make management decisions. This knowledge will be highly beneficial to researchers around the world when deciding what approach is needed for detecting change in an ecosystem of interest.

Experiences of imposter phenomenon,"This project will explore experiences of imposter phenomenon (IP) in the global digital infrastructure workforce. IP is experienced as a dull sense of impending doom ahead of an imagined inevitable discovery that a person is pretending to be competent, or that a terrible mistake has been made about their being put in a particular project or job. IP is associated with higher levels of stress, burnout, anxiety, depression, fear of failure, and lack of self-confidence but little is known about how workplace factors such as psychosocial work environments (PWEs) might influence its prevalence or impacts. PWEs are the opportunities provided by work and the workplace to meet needs for wellbeing, productivity, and positive self-experience (Siegriost & Marmot 2004).
IP is a particular concern for the global digital infrastructure sector. This sector provides digital services essential to cloud-based infrastructure and internet-enabled technologies. The sector faces major challenges in expanding and diversifying its workforce, partly because people from non-traditional backgrounds face potential risks experiencing IP in such workplaces due to feeling 'other' because they are different, marginalised or in the minority.
This project will undertake a large scale mixed method exploration of interrelationships between the PWE, workplace experiences of IP, psychosocial risk and PsyCap. Psychological capital (PsyCap) is an individual's positive psychological state of development characterized by feelings of hope, optimism, self-efficacy and resilience, and has strong and significant relationships with mental health and well-being (Avey, Reichard, Luthans, and Mhatre 2011).  Research questions could include, but not be limited to:

Developing volunteer leaders,"Scholarship in the field of leadership, while increasingly popular and prominent, is focused almost exclusively on paid leaders who hold substantive, managerial roles and lead teams of paid employees. But, in Tasmania, the largest sector by involvement is volunteering, meaning that far more people lead and are led in a voluntary (unpaid) capacity than in a paid capacity. Throughout Tasmania and around the world, volunteers deliver essential services such as community care, emergency response, animal welfare, sport and recreation, and environmental stewardship. And yet, almost no resources are invested to understand how to develop leadership in this vital sector.
Volunteer leadership receives sparse scholarly attention and scant resources for organisational development and capacity building. The vast majority of leadership development research and resources are directed at paid leaders in large organisations, which leaves a glaring gap of knowledge and opportunity to develop the capacity of individuals who volunteer their time to lead in the volunteer sector. This PhD project seeks to fill this gap.
The successful candidate will use the new UTAS Behavioural Economics Lab to empirically establish the difference(s) between volunteer leadership and paid leadership. In the experiment, equivalent volunteer leaders and paid leaders will be engaged in a leadership development program with a focus on understanding the differences in performance between the two groups. Once key differences are established, the candidate will explore possible theoretical explanations for the identified differences before testing propositions to establish evidenced ways to develop the leadership capacity of volunteer leaders. Further experiments will be used to validate leadership development strategies tailored to the volunteer sector in Tasmania and beyond.
The successful candidate will be supervised by leadership and behavioural and experimental economics experts and will join a growing team of scholars and doctoral candidates researching volunteer leadership within the University of Tasmania.

Returning Raw Genomic Research Results Issues for Clinicians and Researchers,"Increasingly, individuals, particularly cancer patients, are undergoing genomic sequencing. Genome sequencing data is presenting new opportunities for diagnosis, treatment and research. A significant amount of genomic data is generated in a research context, and the divide between the clinical and research settings is becoming increasingly blurred. There has been recent debate around obligations to return raw genomic data to patients and research participants, both legal and ethical. The legal position around the return of raw genomic data is not clear, and ethical obligations add a layer of complexity. Although there are good reasons to return genomic data, there may also be associated risks and liabilities. These risks and liabilities must be balanced against the benefits of prioritising patient autonomy and data sharing.
This project begins to unpack these risks and liabilities, and maps the legal landscape across a number of jurisdictions. It incorporates a comparative, doctrinal analysis, to attempt to find common ground in developing an international framework for the return of raw genomic data. This project will supplement work being undertaken on a Medical Research Futures Fund, Genomics Health Futures Mission grant, Returning Raw Genomic Data: Patient Autonomy or Legal Minefield? It will add an international dimension to the work, and fill a gap in the literature by taking a global, holistic approach to resolving a fundamental issue confronting clinicians and researchers.

The co-evolution of technology and research work,"Technological advancements in areas such as autonomous vehicles and remote sensing technology present potentially radical changes to the scientific, research, engineering and technological (RSET) work in done in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean (ASO). Some will open up new forms of work, including research and science activities that were not previously possible. Others will create new possibilities for the ways in which work is done, such as by enabling collection of data using remote controlled technology.
These developments have implications for the employment experience of conducting RSET-related work in Antarctic and the Southern Ocean when they change ways of working and what this kind of work involves. Arguably the greatest impact will be the separation of doing RSET work related to Antarctica and the Southern Ocean from the performance of that work in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, radically changing what people can expect and experience when undertaking ASO-related work.

Amino acid requirements of juvenile tropical (Panulirus ornatus): towards the development of effective formulated feeds,"This project will focus on defining optimum protein quality by determining key essential amino acid requirements for juvenile topical and slipper lobsters. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the importance of between meal changes in tissue amino acid supply, balance and fluxes into growth or metabolism. The research will combine established and cutting-edge methods to understand amino acid metabolism at multiple levels and specifically related to how well amino acid requirements are being met or not met. Classic factorial modelling of amino acid requirements will establish the base experimental approach. Advanced respirometry, combining oxygen consumption with carbon dioxide and nitrogenous excretion, will determine changes in substrate utilisation within 24-h cycles and incorporate between meal changes in amino acid supply to tissues. Protein turnover will be measured because it underlies growth, is strongly influenced by dietary protein quality (amino acid balance) and has high energy costs. Stable isotope tracking to the level of specific amino acids will be developed and provide further detail on metabolic pathways and specific amino acid retention efficiencies (e.g. Barreto-Curiel et al 2019). Targeted transcriptomics or proteomics may then be used to understand how gene regulation relates to differences in protein turnover and amino acid fluxes. The research will ultimately help explain mechanisms that underpin dietary differences in whole-animal growth efficiency and provide a detailed basis for feed formulation.

Assessing the efficacy of nudging techniques for prompting business start-ups,"During COVID-19, businesses have modified their operations to capitalise on online market opportunities, impacting labour market conditions. While this has made it more difficult to find traditional work, this online revolution has also created the opportunity for people to set up a business cost-effectively, i.e., without the need for investing in expensive bricks and mortar. However, incentives are required to encourage under and unemployed workers from traditional labour markets to start sustainable business ventures. One potential tool is to use behavioural science ‘nudging’ techniques, commonly applied to encourage people to make healthier or more sustainable choices, to prompt people to start their own business.
This project brings together the disciplines of entrepreneurship and behavioural economics to consider the efficacy of nudging techniques in encouraging business start-ups. The research focuses on Tasmania, a state with high underemployment in Australia and a high proportion of low paid/skilled jobs. The successful candidate will leverage insights from the nudging literature in relation to entrepreneurship to create prompts for particular cohorts, e.g., under and unemployed youth in regional areas, to start their own business. They will use survey methods to follow up on those participating in the nudge to monitor long-term effects on attitudes/behaviours.
The project will help identify whether and how nudges can be designed and applied to encourage under and unemployed workers to start sustainable business ventures. The outcomes will be of interest to agencies supporting sustainable business growth in regional and remote areas where traditional job opportunities are constrained.

Changes to ocean temperature extremes,"Marine heatwaves and cold spells, or discrete periods of prolonged ocean temperature extremes, can have devastating impacts on marine ecosystems (e.g. Garrabou et al. 2009; Wernberg et al. 2013; Smale et al. 2019). Understanding observed and projected changes to ocean temperature extremes is critical for determining whether marine species and ecosystems may have the capacity to adapt to a changing climate. A common approach to defining marine heatwaves and cold spells is based on temperatures above or below the 90th and 10th temperature percentile thresholds, respectively, relative to an appropriate baseline climatology (Hobday et al. 2016). Using such a definition, it is clear that as ocean temperatures rise under global warming, marine heatwaves have and will continue to increase in their intensity, duration, and frequency (Oliver et al., 2018). Conversely, marine cold spells have been declining. But warming rates are not uniform across the global ocean, at least in part due to the influence of modes of climate variability, such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (Holbrook et al. 2019). An added complication is that changes to the temperature variability, on a range of time scales, can also affect longer-term changes in the extremes.
Some elements of the marine environment have the capacity to respond to unfavourable conditions, e.g. fish can migrate, and plant life may adapt. Therefore, it can be useful to employ alternative marine heatwave and cold spell definitions that account for a changing baseline climatology (e.g. Jacox et al. 2020; Chiswell 2021). With a moving baseline definition, it is also more straightforward to understand trends due to temperature variability changes.

Interpretable Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been emerging as an important technology with significant influence on many aspects of life. In the era of digital media, modern AI approaches, known as ""deep learning"" methods, can effectively utilise the large availability of data and the computational powers for highly accurate prediction. This advancement has made breakthroughs in a number of application domains, for example, object detection and classification in autonomous driving systems, and automated diagnosis from medical images. However, deep learning methods also receive some concern from the business and society due to the lack of explanation and interpretation capability for the prediction outcomes.  Without the interpretability, humans will not be able to understand the behaviour of AI to establish trust and to acquire useful knowledge, e.g. we want to know not only whether there is a disease or not from a medical image but also why?
Current approaches for interpretable AI focus on extracting semantic relationships of features that form a prediction, while little has been done for the integration of representing and learning of the semantics. This project will study graph neural network (GNN) with attention mechanism to achieve semantical and visual interpretation for decision makings from image data.

Using education analytics to optimise STEM degree admission and applicant success prediction,"Higher education is facing a difficult future. The current pandemic has significantly impacted upon international enrolments, budgets are being cut and the impact of rapid online teaching responses have all taken their toll.  Academics are increasingly having to adapt and teach students from a broader range of sources that are too frequently ill prepared for University study. The entry requirements for some disciplines have also reduced over the past two decades leading to more ‘remedial’ teaching and support systems to facilitate student success. These entry requirements are perceived as being more informed by budget and enrolment targets (and considering attrition) than ensuring quality of outcomes, but there is minimal literature to suggest an alternative, tested model for selecting based on success potential. This project will develop a model for selecting applicants based on their likelihood of success in their field of study. The outcomes will potentially revolutionise the higher education selection process and ensure that new students are in a study path that will result in a good outcome.
This project takes a data driven approach to identifying success factors for university study and provide a prediction tool by which all new applicants can be assessed. Foundation work done by the Principal Supervisor at Flinders university focussed on success factors for online learning. (Work on success modelling for applicants was conducted but is unable to be shared due to confidentiality.) Previous work demonstrated that it is possible to predict the success potential of a student based on education history, teaching delivery and other personal characteristics. The work proposed for this PhD project would take that learning and develop a model by which applicants could be evaluated and success factors determined to help guide admissions and potentially provide a mechanism by which applicants could be counselled on learning and study pathways that would present the highest potential for individual success.
The project would utilise a number of computer science skills including analytics, machine learning, programming, security, human factors, and deep data interrogation.

Design of dynamics of interactive conversations in Virtual Reality for Soldier training,"Soldiers can be located in extreme environment and hazardous situations, and using VR associated with the conversation proves an extremely efficient way to train soldiers among various situations and environment, such as flight simulations, battlefield simulations, job training and etc.
At present, most conversations embedded in virtual reality are typically structured interaction. This would allow conversations to take place and would be the normal method of communication. This form of conversation representation is restrictive, allowing for only a few predetermined responses to performing a few simple tasks. We can generalise these limitations in two prime categories, lacks adaptive and dynamic conversation content and a significant lack of relationships between conversational interface and knowledge.
These limitations provide an opportunity which motivates us to develop the next generation of conversation engine that is a cohesive unit of intelligent CLT (Control Language Interface) with assisted rule-based technology and adaptability at its core. The design of this conversation engine is intended to effectively identify the required knowledge for the soldiers while interacting and develop a broader range of contents with an agile delivery mechanism that can cater a wider scope defense situations and environment. We propose our approach that specifically addresses the above-mentioned limitations by targeting the following:
In our system, the interactive conversations will be dynamically changed and adaptive to various VR situations and environment. This unique and novel concept will enable the soldiers to invoke live knowledge generation during training as he/she explores additional information with experiences. Moreover, it will enhance and expand the core knowledge engine, by a wider range of contexts and their inter-matching connectivity to establish conversational flow in various domains of knowledge.

Immersive Visualisation with Point Cloud Data,"This research will consider how point cloud data and immersive visualisation technologies might contribute to the sustainable development and management of built and natural environments in urban areas. It will use sites within the Northern and Southern Transformation Projects of the University of Tasmania as the context of investigation.
Rapidly increasing density and accuracy of 3D point cloud data makes it timely to investigate the potential use of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) applications. VR offers the potential for users to transfer their acquired skills to within a 3D and 1:1 scaled immersive environment, constructed from the point cloud data. For example, inventory field operators have been using VR to perform inventory assessment tasks with high-resolution point cloud data acquired from the forest (Chinthammit, 2019). While users feel immersed and can use their existing skills in a point cloud environment, the accuracy of the assessment tasks performed in VR was inferior to the work performed in the field. The findings prompt the importance of understanding how users perceive and make decisions within an immersive point cloud environment. This research will investigate fundamental visualisation elements such as depth perception, distance estimation and structure estimation of VR representations of point cloud data of urban environments.
Applicants should suggest a provisional project scope that includes (1) an urban site/s from the Northern and Southern Transformation Projects, (2) a set of point cloud characteristics (density, accuracy and precision) and (3) an application domain from within the built environment domain (design, construction, assessment, management and conservation) that would benefit from immersive visualisation. Specifically, the research will look at human perception and task efficacy in relation to practical uses of the point cloud data in the chosen domain. Potential use-cases include conservation and management of built and natural heritage in the urban domains of the transformation projects.

Tasmanian Fruit Industry Workforce,"The Tasmanian fruit industry contributes around $197 million and the vegetable industry over $251 million to the state economy. The North West coast is at the centre of Tasmania's vegetable and fruit industry. As with much of Australia, the harvest of this seasonal produce is heavily dependent on temporary visa holders who have at times been subject to exploitative labour practices. The fragility of these arrangements has been further exposed by the Covid-19 pandemic and consequent border closures, leading to further concerns about the ongoing viability of these arrangements.
The University of Tasmania's goal is to work in partnership with community, industry and government to create a prosperous and sustainable future. This project goes to the heart of this intention. The North West coast fruit and vegetable industry is located in a region with high levels of unemployment, underemployment and disadvantage. It has been the source of debates about the viability of the current dependence of temporary visa holders and the issues involved in recruiting and retaining a local workforce. This project aims to develop place-based solutions that will provide a sustainable North West coast fruit and vegetable workforce. The project sits within TSBE's Sustainable Work and Well Being research cluster and addresses the strategic issues of improving Tasmania's economic performance and social inclusion.
The candidate will undertake qualitative research and generate case studies in the North West coast fruit and vegetable industry. The candidate should have a strong social science background and will be expected to take a multi-disciplinary approach and engage with growers, employers, workers, government, unions and the community. This project seeks to develop theoretical and practical insights into the enablers and barriers to employment in the North West coast fruit and vegetable workforce. The successful candidate will be supervised by an expert social science team who address these concerns in a variety of settings.

Challenge-based learning in ICT education,"Higher education must equip students with the transversal skills required to contribute to the global economy, environment, and societies of the future. Graduates need to be prepared with strong disciplinary knowledge combined with problem solving, critical and computational thinking and social integration skills to be able to achieve societal impact on some of the more wicked problems, such as sustainability and climate impact.
This project will explore the role that ICT education can have in preparing students to be able to contribute constructively to solving some of societies more complex problems using technology by examining the impact of integrating Challenge-based learning (CBL) into the ICT undergraduate learning experience. This phd project incorporates the design, development and evaluation of integrating CBL within the ICT undergraduate learning experience using sociotechnical complex problems.
CBL is an innovative teaching methodology that engages students in solving real-world challenges by applying the skills and knowledge they acquired during their course. There has been much recent research into integrating this relatively new pedagogical approach into education, with limited research in the field of ICT education where it has been shown to better prepare graduates for the new challenges and opportunities provided by ICT. CBL in ICT education would facilitate a multidisciplinary approach that encourages students to collaborate actively with peers, industry, community, and other stakeholders to identify complex sociotechnical challenges, formulate relevant questions and develop solutions.

Optimising Active Learning for Efficient Data Annotation,"While there have been great AI advances in image understanding, the most successful approaches require a very large training dataset of annotated images. Obtaining suitable images is often not very difficult, but the bottleneck is in obtaining ground truth annotations, which typically requires human experts.  This has been a major inhibiting factor in the application of these techniques in real-world application.
Techniques such as semi-supervised learning and active learning have been suggested to reduce the requirement for labelled data.  In both cases the model is initially trained with a small amount of labelled data.  The model is then refined by self-labelling additional data or by selecting additional unlabelled images for expert labelling.
Conversely, generative adversarial networks (GANs) may be used to generate additional images for training.  In this case, the network is trained to generate labelled synthetic images using only a small dataset for training.  This can be a powerful form of dataset augmentation.
This project will investigate the combination of these two complementary approaches.  That is, the system will utilise labelled and unlabelled data to build a GAN that may produce additional labelled data.  This new data will then be used to refine the model using semi-supervised and/or active learning approaches.
By combining these, and potentially other, approaches, it is hoped that an efficient image understanding workflow can be developed that enables greater application of this transformative technology.  One such application is the identification of animal species in camera trap images.  Accurate automated identification would allow greater use of this low-cost technique for environmental monitoring.  Once developed, the system will be validated by making use of a new camera trap image dataset.

The Novel in the 21st-Century,"In Everything and Less: The Novel in the Age of Amazon, Mark McGurl writes that the ""rise of Amazon is the most significant novelty in recent literary history, representing an attempt to reforge contemporary literary life as an adjunct to online retail."" Many readers are now positioning themselves publicly as 'literary' by reviewing novels online, and participating passionately in bookish social media, often through avenues that are affiliated with writers, publishers or booksellers.
The Novel in the 21st Century invites projects that examine the relationship between the literary features of contemporary novels and the social and/or material practices that support their production and reception. How do novelists depict contemporary literary culture or respond to it through literary techniques? How do readers signal their allegiances to specific kinds of books, genres, or writers? What is the place of 'literature' in a complex, global book market increasingly mediated by large technology companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google? What is the purpose of the novel today and how do contemporary novels address this question?
This project might consider such aspects of the contemporary literary ecosystem as publishing, bookselling, reading, reviewing, or online literary culture. Applications that combine close or comparative literary analysis with sociological or quantitative methods are strongly encouraged.

Ecological Monitoring in the Southern Ocean,"The Southern Ocean represents 20% of the world’s oceans. It is undeniable that the Southern Ocean has changed over the past 30 years with warming waters, changing currents, changes in fisheries management and illegal fishing. Furthermore, climate predictions suggest further drastic changes into the future.
Monitoring plays a critical role in understanding how environmental and other changes are affecting key species, assemblages and ecosystems in order to inform appropriate management or adaption strategies. Monitoring programs need to have enough sampling and power to detect changes. However, monitoring is also expensive, time-consuming and logistically difficult, particularly in remote regions such as the Southern Ocean.  Resources are limited and programs need to be designed to make the most of historical and currently available information, which may include legacy sites, opportunistic sampling, multiple platforms and models (statistical, mathematical and simulation).
This project will use existing biological and environmental data and simulation models as the basis to investigate various aspects of designing monitoring programs for key assemblages in the Southern Ocean. These may include demersal fish, zooplankton, or benthic fauna. It will investigate how best to develop, refine or augment monitoring for one or more of these key assemblages by addressing questions such as:
While these questions are particularly timely for Southern Ocean ecosystems, the methodologies developed here, and our results will be more broadly applicable to monitoring programs being developed elsewhere.

Public Engagement in Antarctic Histories,"A recent survey of people living in Australia’s Antarctic “gateway” city, Hobart, showed significant connections between a sense of the city’s Antarctic history and a desire to protect the continent through everyday behaviour (Leane et al, “From gateway to custodian city,” Geographical Research 2021). This project investigates the most effective ways to engage people – whether citizens or tourists – in the country’s rich Antarctic histories. Supported by the Mawson’s Huts Foundation (MHF), the project comes with a bursary of $5000, and may also include the chance to undertake an internship in the MHF’s Mawson’s Huts Replica Museum on the Hobart waterfront.
The project is designed to accommodate applicants from a range of disciplinary areas, including historical studies, heritage studies, literary studies, creative writing and creative arts, and tourism studies. We are particularly interested in projects that use archival materials – such as diaries, letters, and logbooks – to retell or reimagine the lives of the people and objects that comprise Australia’s engagement with the far south. However, we are open to considering any project or approach that addresses public engagement with Antarctic histories.
You will work with an expert supervision team designed around your particular project and disciplinary approach, and will benefit from the University’s international networks and active research culture in the areas of HASS-based Antarctic Studies, Life Writing and/or Tourism Studies. You will also form strong connections within the Antarctic sector through the access this project provides the MHF’s people and resources and through the networks available in the Australian Antarctic “gateway”.
Based on your qualifications, expertise and interests, and in conversation with the prospective supervision team, you are invited to shape this project in your own way.

Metaphysics and Social Ontology,"In order to make sense of the world we must categorise its contents and assume various relations between these categories. This is true whether we are talking about fundamental particles and fields, social categories such as gender and sexuality, or the general distinction between properties and particulars. Once we recognise these assumptions we can question their legitimacy: what is their relation to reality? What are the ethical or epistemic implications of these assumptions? What is the purpose of these categorisations? Are there better ways of categorising the world?

Self Diagnostic Systems for IIoT,"The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gathers a large amount of data for a specific target environment. The data can describe the environment's state and is used for future decisions regarding the system. Blockchain gives the assurance that the data used or generated by the IoT devices is valid and reliable. When combined with blockchain, IoT devices enable the complete automation of different tasks that do not require constant human interactions or monitoring. Typical examples of IoT and Blockchain in the industries include automatic payments and supply chain management.
IIoT can replace manual maintenance and machine-related diagnostics with a slow but continuous online process to predict and prevent future failures. A key challenge with implementing IIoT is determining the correct configuration that enables the system to capture the best possible data set for decision making. Various reasons for failure include broken individual devices, damaged network setup or incorrect deployment strategies. Blockchain can provide integrity to this approach of self-monitoring and diagnosis of IIoT to provide an appropriate level of service quality by deploying the monitoring scheme in a secure, trusted and distributed manner.
The research aim of this project will be to determine the proper data storage methods and possible data moderation between different sources of data from multiple IIoT devices. Devices placed on prototype machinery will be used to collect data for creating a health index for the machines and the devices connected to them. The outcome will be a method to properly differentiate and isolate the failures of the IIoT devices to capture the machine's states correctly, from the actual failures of the machine and quantify this difference using machine learning techniques. It will further develop strategies to assimilate newly identified persistent problems into an existing pool of know issues about a particular IIoT system.

Engaged Phenomenology,"Since Plato's 'Divided Line' metaphysics, philosophy has grappled with the many problems arising from dualism and more recently with reductive materialism. Such ontologies have given rise to many of the 'big questions' of philosophy - How is it that I can know a world external to myself when all I directly access are my own thoughts and representations? How can I be sure that what I perceive is accurate?  How is it that the mind influences the body and vice versa? Is there something it is like to have a particular experience? Can I empathically grasp the experience of another? How is it that we can understand and share aesthetic experiences? Is it possible to identify an artwork or art performance as 'great art'? What is happening with mind-body-world relations in anomalous experience – such as in the challenges to mental health? And there are many more such questions.
In the early 20th Century, philosopher Edmund Husserl established a rigorous philosophical framework – phenomenology – which directly challenges both dualism and reductive materialism, bringing to the fore the importance of lived experience and the life-world in addressing philosophical problems. His work has been further developed by other phenomenologists – Edith Stein, Max Scheler, Martin Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and others. Merleau-Ponty notably built his philosophical vision on the key axes of the body, perception and intersubjectivity. Phenomenology is now a powerful voice on the philosophical stage which is proving its value not only to philosophy but also to the human sciences.
The philosophy program invites applications for projects that address research questions in the domains of embodied cognition, enactivism, aesthetics, philosophy of psychiatry, philosophy of perception, feminism and ethics informed by the work of phenomenological thinkers past and present.

How do Clinical Exercise Services affect health outcomes?,"Physical inactivity is an important contributor to the alarming incidence many chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and there is substantial evidence of the effectiveness of exercise training for a wide range of chronic diseases. This evidence has led to the Australian Government including referrals to and treatment by Accredited Exercise Physiologists (AEPs) under Medicare for people with a range of chronic medical conditions. However, a limitation of the existing evidence for exercise as a treatment comes from laboratory studies that are highly controlled and often do not reflect clinical practice outcomes. Additionally, this research may not readily translate to beneficial outcomes beyond the conclusion of the prescribed intervention period/research study. To date there have been few assessments of the benefits of exercise services delivered as part of usual clinical practice on physical activity participation and health outcomes in people with chronic disease.
AEPs are allied health professionals trained to prescribe exercise and facilitate long term behaviour change in sub clinical and clinical populations. The first part of this project will assess the effectiveness of AEP led lifestyle interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus in clinical practice settings. It will examine the effect of EP services on physical activity, clinical measures and behaviour change over a six-month period. It is the first study to assess the effectiveness of this type of health treatment using real patient data. This is a multi-centre project which requires collaboration with other institutes and may involve opportunities for interstate travel.

"Transport disadvantage, isolation and gentrification","Rapid urbanisation is driving social and spatial changes to cities globally. Its social effects include growing income divides, disparities in urban service accessibility (e.g., public transport), rising levels of income insecurity, housing unaffordability, segregation, and social isolation and loneliness. Planners have typically sought to address such issues through ‘spatial fixes’ (e.g., urban densification and infill). Purportedly, by efficiently using existing infrastructure (e.g., water, sewerage & electricity) economic and environmental costs can be reduced. Higher density housing is thought to accommodate more people in closer proximity to schools, parks, employment centres, healthcare and other urban services. Evidence suggests such planning policies can have unintended consequences. These include rising property prices and rent, and gentrification. People able to afford higher prices benefit from better services and amenity, whereas those who cannot are displaced to the suburban periphery, with reduced access to urban services, and higher levels of car-dependence.
Transport disadvantage is poorly understood in small to mid-size cities. According to BITRE, Hobart and Launceston are among the worst performing cities in Australia for residents’ access to public transportation. This PhD project will examine the impacts of City Deal initiatives in Greater Hobart and Greater Launceston, designed to promote urban infill, reduce car-dependence and improve housing affordability. The project will examine whether these interventions are reducing or exacerbating transport and housing disadvantage. Such disadvantage is not just a function of residential location it also has social dimensions, acutely impacting people with disabilities, children and teenagers, and people with cultural and linguistic diversity. The project will develop a robust understanding of the issue in Tasmania, using a mixed-methods research design (e.g., spatial analysis, interviews, participant observation, e-diaries and visual creative methods), with the objective of informing evidence-based policy.

Student housing: Infrastructures of care,"This project is part of a suite of research about how the University of Tasmania's campus transformation program is being shaped by, and in turn is shaping, urban settings and ideas about people's rights to the city, to basic needs such as housing, and to ideas about how the provision of dwelling space is also about the provision of what geographers are calling infrastructures of care. To be contextualised in the literature on university transformation processes internationally, the project may focus on three questions - although others are possible:
(a) What approaches has the University taken or will it take in relation to the provision of student housing prior to the mid-2000s, from the mid-2000s to the present, and for the period planned to 2030?
(b) How has the University accounted for, and how will it continue to account for regenerative and sustainable design principles in the provision of student housing?
(c) How does the University's approach to student housing compare with that taken by select universities in other regional and island settings with similar jurisdictional and governance arrangements involving local, state or provincial, and national governments?
A central argument that could be tested is that universities can and should be leaders in the provision of student housing as infrastructures of care. The significance of the work is that it will add to a growing international literature on universities as anchor institutions in their communities and provide timely and specific insights on the University of Tasmania's own transformation processes.

Early Detection of Cognitive Decline,"Neurodegenerative conditions like dementia affect millions and have no known cure, making early detection important. In Australia, more than 459,000 people are living with dementia, at a cost of $15 billion per year. With ageing populations, the prevalence is rapidly rising and is expected to be over 1 million by 2058 (Health Direct Australia, 2019). The primary aim of this project is to investigate AI based early detection algorithms using the speech and text data collected from people with neurodegenerative conditions.
There is evidence that spoken language is an informed representation of an individual's cognitive status (Asgari et al., 2017) and that speech analysis could potentially be used as a quick test of 'pre-symptomatic' cognitive status (Kindell et al., 2017). Recently, new research evidence shows that spoken language reveals cognitive status, and speech analysis can classify Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy control (HC) group (Luz et al., 2020). However, the current analysis of language impairment depends on intensive labor, since high-fidelity speech transcripts are needed (Asgari et al., 2017). Hence this multi-discipline project aims to fill the gap with an automated language-based assessment that offers a broad availability for potential patients with neurodegenerative disorders and facilitates further corresponding treatment.
We will train an algorithm to differentiate those adults with normal cognition from those with accelerated cognitive decline. Machine learning and knowledge discovery methods will map how combinations of speech features discriminate normal ageing from accelerated cognitive ageing. Mixed methods of audio and text analysis are emerging as potential early indicators of cognitive decline. Therefore, there are two processes will be conducted: audio analysis, and transcript analysis.

Renewable energy risk changing climate,"Renewable energy is a critical component of an emerging and thriving green economy, and Australia is well-placed to take advantage or renewable energy produced by a number of different sources. However, the risk posed by climate change itself to renewable energy sources, such as water or wind, is likely to have important impacts on the successful transition to reliance on renewable energy sources. Understanding long-term baseline conditions is a critical part of modelling risk for renewable energy sources.  This needs to be coupled with knowledge provided through regional climate models to obtain an expanded view of climate risk to the renewable energy sector going forward. A further question concerns how the financial risk to providers of renewable energy may be ameliorated in a way such that ongoing and responsible investment in renewable energy infrastructure is encouraged.

"Insurance, inequity, and place","Large and small metropolitan areas are experiencing the impacts of climate change. In places like Florida (United States), for example, the wealthy are moving to higher ground, displacing the poor into suburbs at high risk of flooding and inundation. As part of the University of Tasmania’s insurance research program, you will work with Dr Kate Booth – a leading expert in insurance geographies and critical insurance studies – to develop a project focusing on the co-constitution of real estate, equity, and insurance. In the context of climate change, this may include considerations of insurance affordability and availability, urban planning and policy, and geographies of affect and power.

Cooperative Multiple Drone System for Unknown Environment Exploration,"Unmanned Aerial Drones have received attention and have been widely applied in many application domains, including traffic monitoring, and the logistics and environment monitoring. Single drone systems are suffering from short battery life and small working radius, which greatly limit their applications in applications like search and rescue (SAR) or hidden area exploration. Cooperative MDSs is a cutting-edge area in robotics and multi-agent systems (MAS) and can cover many critical limitations in single drone systems. However, the coordination and control of MDSs are still challenging research issues blocking them from many real-world applications.
This project will investigate the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in MDS controlling and scheduling. Novel coordination mechanisms will be designed and implemented to support multiple drones to execute exploration tasks in unknown areas. Different with existing drone systems, multiple drones will work together to achieve a common goal in a dynamic environment. Responsibilities and resources will be allocated to different drones in a cooperative manner with learning-based automated coordination’s.

Maternal health information seeking,"Maternal health information and healthcare-seeking behaviour is crucial to women’s health and is an important public health issue. Maternal and child health morbidity and mortality depend highly on the health information and healthcare-seeking behaviour of mothers. Several factors, including educational background, occupation, age, pregnancy-related complications, and socio-cultural influences are known to affect behaviour. Analyses of 13 years of Tasmanian hospital record data (through a data linkage project) have shown indigenous women have a higher rate of obesity and a high incidence of premature births and low birth weight in newborns. Tasmanian aboriginal women also have low education and socioeconomic status, low literacy, higher smoking, and alcohol intake compared to non-indigenous pregnant women.

GPS measurement of deformation of East Antarctica,"Antarctica continues to deform as a result of past and present surface loading changes, especially ice loading changes, and Earthquake-related effects. Over the last 10 years, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers have been increasingly deployed in Antarctica to measure surface deformation. These data are now yielding sufficiently precise surface velocity time series to be able to separate competing models and in doing so learn new things about the interior of the Earth and the past ice loading history.
This project will focus on the analysis of GPS data with state-of-the-art techniques in order to better understand the deformation of Antarctica. It will make use of a new set of GPS sites in East Antarctica deployed. It will apply novel techniques to remove time series noise and compare these to numerical models developed from existing codes and from outputs provided by third parties. These results will be important for understanding present-day ice-sheet contribution to sea-level rise and in gaining fundamental understanding into the interior of the Earth. The project will provide students with advanced skills in numerical analysis, interpretation and presentation.

"Geoconservation significance of alpine dunes, central Tasmania","Sand dunes are common coastal landforms, however inland dunes occur in Tasmania, where within the alpine World Heritage area contribute to the distinctive landscape. Understanding is restricted to description with some chronology associated with past climates. This inductive research investigates alpine dune geomorphology, sedimentology and morphology to assess their geoconservation significance – understanding the ways in which alpine dune formation conforms to or varies from coastal dune formation. The research will allow development of skills in landform surveying, spatial change analysis, and techniques in sediment analysis. Research will focus on the World Heritage area, investigating spatial and topographic trends, and recent changes analysed to identify mobility and threats. Sedimentology will be analysed to investigate sources and weathering trends. Values will be analysed to contribute to geoconservation priorities. Results will contribute to global understanding of inland aeolian alpine dunes and geoconservation significance.

Fire risk attribution using remote sensing,"There are three drivers of fire behaviour: fuel, weather and topography. High-resolution weather predictions have been improving, and technology advances in lidar allow us to map topography and forest structure in greater detail than ever before. However, our poor understanding of fuel hazard and lack of fuel data is a critical gap in our knowledge of fire behaviour.
Fuel is the only element of wildfire behaviour that human intervention can readily manage to reduce wildfire risk. Therefore, it is critically important that fire agencies understand how fuels change in space and time (fuel dynamics) and the impact of these changes on forest flammability. There are two important components of fuels: fuel moisture and fuel structure. Fuel structure is the arrangement of vegetation elements across the vertical profile of a forest system. Broadly speaking, the more fuel there is, and the more connected this fuel is, the more flammable the landscape. Fuel moisture is the amount of water in the fuel relative to its dry mass and it dictates how readily fire will burn through a fuel, and the energy released in the process.
While recent research has demonstrated the ability of remote sensing techniques to measure fuel structure and moisture. These observations do not readily combine into metrics for fire behaviour models. This PhD project will consider three main knowledge gaps:

Understanding compound climate extremes,"Climate and weather extremes may occur over weeks, seasons, or even years.  The IPCC has characterised compound extremes in particular as an area of ‘deep uncertainty’, with little understood about their probability of occurrence or cascading impacts. Instrumental evidence and climate projections indicate increased frequency and magnitude of both single event and compound extremes over recent decades and into the future, respectively. The impacts of some types of extremes – both single and compound - can be captured in palaeoclimate records. Because the impacts of more frequent or severe climate extremes are perceived as major threats to social and environmental well-being across the globe, there is an urgent need to better characterise these extremes. This will help to better inform infrastructure design and land management planning.
This PhD project will play a key role in improving our understanding of extremes. This project will involve compiling and analysing globally gridded data sets and instrumental records at scales commensurate with types of climate extremes recorded in palaeoclimate records. It will also include calibration of a record of palaeo-extremes and comparison with long runs of CSIRO’s climate model to identify likely drivers of temporally and spatially compound events in the palaeoclimate record.

Climate variability in Antarctica,"This project focuses on the reasons why the mass of the Antarctic Ice Sheet changes and hence why Antarctica’s contribution to sea level varies over time. The project will make use of two different satellite datasets: 1) revolutionary estimates of ice sheet mass change from the GRACE and GRACE-Follow On missions; and 2) incredibly fine detailed estimates of ice sheet elevation change from a range of satellite altimetry missions.
The particular focus on the project will be the role of large-scale climate variability in forcing ice sheet mass change. It is now established that major modes of climate variability, most clearly El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), affect the ice sheet via the atmosphere and ocean, resulting in (for example) ice shelf melt rates. This project will use both GRACE and altimetry measurements to study these variations over the grounded ice sheet. They will be interpreted using a range of climate model outputs and information on a range of climate modes, including ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM).
The project will contribute to the $25M ARC Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science (ACEAS; antarctic.org.au) a collaboration of eight leading universities and ~40 of Australia’s leading Antarctic and Southern Ocean scientists. The candidate will benefit from the substantial community of researchers within ACEAS and receive training in Antarctic science, policy, law and governance, and other support from the ACEAS Graduate Training Coordinator.
Candidates will gain advanced skills in analysis of geodetic data and various climate datasets, and generic skills in communication, data analysis, problem solving, and critical thinking. There is substantial employment demand for both these specific and generic skills, within academia, industry, and government.

Climate Change and Disability Justice,"For marginalised at-risk populations climate and urbanism discourses are of great importance due to the disproportionate impact of climate change on such groups. While international research is making a more concerted effort to actively included some populations in communication and strategies, the disability community have been consistently omitted.  The wide-ranging exclusion is concerning, as climate change is expected to affect people with disabilities in three ways: 1. most likely to have limited access to knowledge, resources, and services to effectively respond to environmental change; 2. more vulnerable to extreme climate events, ecosystem services loss, or infectious diseases; 3. more likely to have difficulties during required evacuations or migrations (Kosanic et al. 2019).
The United Nations Human Rights Council in 2019 adopted a resolution calling on governments to adopt a disability-inclusive approach to addressing climate change, yet there remains a dearth of research and policy strategy that is inclusive of disabled people internationally and in Australian. Eco-ableism, a form of discrimination towards people with disabilities through ecological- environmental lens (Wolbring et al., 2017) is also thwarting progress.
Addressing the invisibility of the disability community is of utmost priority for the lives of Tasmanians with disabilities, as Tasmania has the highest proportion of people with disabilities compared to all other states and territories in Australia (26.8%, 1 in 4), who also experience intersecting inequality in housing and transport.
This foundational PhD project will examine the impacts of climate change and eco-ableism regarding Tasmanians with disabilities, with the view to identify and map tensions and opportunities for policy and planning strategies to help prepare, mitigate impacts, and build resilience. Adopting qualitative predominated mixed-methods research design (e.g., spatial and policy analysis, co-production creative participant led-methods), the project will develop a robust understanding of the issue in Tasmania, with the objective of informing evidence-based policy.

How can we celebrate diversity through life-writing, amplifying the voices of people who have been pushed into the margins of history and literature, or understand how famous figures have been represented and misrepresented? How are archives formed and by whom, and how do those decisions mask or reveal life stories? Where lives have not been thoroughly documented, how can we make imaginative use of archival material? How can we make space for the more-than-human in this genre?

Vision-based Sensing of Respiration in Preterm Infants,"This project is to investigate the potential for improved sensing of respiration, including respiratory pauses (apnoea), in preterm infants while receiving respiratory support in neonatal intensive care. This forms part of a larger NHMRC-funded “PANDA”* study investigating the performance of systems for sensing and predicting apnoea in preterm infants.
Current sensing of respiration in neonatal intensive care is routinely through inductance plethysmography via ECG electrodes. Unfortunately, this is often unreliable especially during apnoeas where the heartbeat may be misconstrued as respiration, and impacts care and health outcomes. More reliable sensing of respiration will improve care of these infants, and our preliminary research suggests vision-based sensing is a potential solution.
In this project, vision-based sensing systems, including colour and infrared imaging, will be developed for continuously detecting respiration in preterm infants during respiratory support in intensive care. Vision systems will be camera-based and capable of continuous monitoring for extended periods. Novel image processing methods for extracting respiratory motion from the recordings will be developed, utilising conventional and machine learning approaches, and used to extract respiratory motion from the recordings. Respiratory motion will then be characterized over the study period, including periods of apnoea, and compared to routine and other respiration monitoring recorded during PANDA data collection, and performance determined in detecting clinically useful respiratory information including apnoea.
The outcomes of the project will be a thorough investigation of vision-based systems for sensing of respiration and potentially a vision-based apnoea monitoring system for clinical use which would be a significant advance in preterm care.
This project will be based in the School of Engineering at the University of Tasmania and involves close liaison with the Neonatal and Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at the Royal Hobart Hospital.

The main aim of this project is to develop a mathematical model and numerical method using the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for studying micro heat sinks with different configurations of micro pin fins and various kinds of nanofluids. LBM is a powerful mesoscopic numerical method for simulation of complex fluid flows.
To study and simulate this problem a basic knowledge of heat and mass transfer, nanofluid, porous media, rheology, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and LBM is required.

Imagined Food Safeties,"Globally, the World Health Organization estimates 600 million cases of foodborne illnesses per year, resulting in 420 thousand deaths. Food safety matters. But food safety is more than statistics about the sick and the dead, more than the technologies of sanitation practices and food handling techniques. Food safety is complex sets of knowledge, of ways of thinking and acting, embedded in institutional practices and discourses, by governments, by industry, and by everyday people. This project is will focus on how people (especially consumers) have thought about food safety over time. By taking a cultural history approach to food safety the project will consider how food safety creates materially, symbolically and experientially a set of ways of thinking and acting, resulting in knowledge that is embedded in institutional practices and discourses.
Projects may focus on a specific geographical exemplar, or on connections between points, or on a specific issue/product. Please note, however, that although a geographic and temporal focus is not stipulated, this is a historical project and requires a background in History or Food Studies.

Risk and Uncertainty for Debris Flows,"Heavy rainfall and a changing climate have a direct correlation with the frequency of large geohazard events. Rainfall is a crucial factor in developing debris flow risk mitigation strategies in a Tasmanian context. Current methods to assess the magnitude of catastrophic debris flows and landslides often account for a variety of possible precipitation events, incorporating inherent variability, uncertainty and spatial variability for rainfall and run-off. Although uncertainty, heterogeneity and spatial dependencies are commonplace in assessing rainfall for debris flow risk, large-scale probabilistic methods have yet to incorporate the variability of geotechnical and hydrological factors.
Numerical simulations have shown that the destructive potential debris flows are particularly sensitive to initial conditions, including debris flow orientation and position, channel geometry, surface roughness and sedimentary concentrations. This research aims to quantify the effects of debris flow uncertainties on the performance protective structures such as check dams, rigid barriers and flexible nets. The project will develop probabilistic methods for Monte Carlo simulation of debris flow run-out behaviour, as well as debris flow barrier performance, incorporating probabilistic assessment tools as part of random field theory, coupled with large deformation numerical simulation. The creation of innovative probabilistic models will drive sustainable engineering solutions for risk mitigation, accommodating for debris flow uncertainty, heterogeneity and spatial variability.

Pumped hydro storage,"This project forms part of the new ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centre for Energy Technologies for Future Grids, a commonwealth funded collaborative initiative between the University of Tasmania and five other major Australian universities, together with fifteen partner organisations from industry. The Training Centre will provide solutions for the problems associated with the transition from fossil-fuel-based and centralised power grids to the renewables-based and decentralised grids of the future. The successful applicant for this project will be provided with opportunities to work as part of the broader training centre team, will work on problems of immediate relevance to industry and will have direct links to and be supported by industry partners.
This research project will explore how displacement of conventional generation by inverter-based generation, such as intermittent renewable energy, creates new requirements for energy storage, rapid and continuous frequency regulation, grid stabilisation and load following, requiring both storage and fast customer load response. In this project, a model for the responsiveness of pumped hydro storage (PHS) will be developed alongside customer engagement in response to the instantaneous support (such as voltage and frequency regulation) needed for power grids during both normal conditions and emergency events. This will include development of full dynamic models of the mechanical and electrical system for pumped storage and its interaction with the power system, to assess the integration of PHS technologies while delivering ancillary services, system strength and grid support, and maximising the hosting capability of the intermittent generation. Several tiers of loads and their interactions with the operation of a PHS using a communication system will also be considered.

Pumped-Storage Hydropower Hydrodynamics,"Increasing power generation from renewable energy has created a need for large-energy storage. Pumped storage hydropower offers a large scale energy storage solution with a high round-trip efficiency. This makes it very a useful technology in a rapidly developing energy market. Tasmania is well positioned in Australia to deliver pumped storage solutions with its abundance of water resources and mountainous terrain. An essential feature in all pumped storage hydropower systems is the capability to store and discharge water efficiently to minimise hydraulic losses. Advanced hydrodynamic design is critical in providing a responsive system for switching between generating and pumping modes while avoiding undesirable effects such as free surface vortices, surge waves, and unsteady machine loading. This project will use the advanced capabilities of computation fluid dynamics to simulate and optimise pumped-storage system hydraulics. Models will be developed to include dynamic effects in both closed and open channel flows. The project will also consider the operation of a shallow water reservoir, which enables wider options for site selection. This project will benefit the local renewable energy sector and assist in addressing a significant challenge for the Australian power sector.

Managing networks and distributed resources on networks so as to enable high hosting capacity of renewables and flexible loads and to enable power systems services to be supplied, while ensuring operation of networks within physical constraints is a considerable challenge yet to be resolved. This project will develop and test novel approaches and methodologies for coordinating and integrating distributed energy resources on constrained electricity networks, so that future networks can be operated to successfully address these challenges.

3D deformation of a heterogeneous Earth,"This project focuses on generating fundamental new insights into the viscoelastic properties of the solid Earth. The solid Earth beneath our feet is constantly changing shape, such as due to plate tectonics, earthquakes, glaciers melting, or the tides. Even far from these events, small deformations (millimetre or even sub-millimetre) can now be measured due to the advent of precise GPS positioning. The theory of what is causing these deformations has lagged behind the observations, however, and new models of the deformations are required.
In particular, it is now clear that we need to represent the full three-dimensional complexity of Earth's structure and viscoelastic properties. This project will further develop finite element models of the whole Earth, and examine its deformation associated with one or more of these major forcings: 1) earthquakes, such as the great Sumatran earthquakes and its effect on Australia; 2) glacier melt from Antarctica, Patagonia, Alaska, or Svalbard; 3) tides – either direct gravitational forcing or due to the changing mass of the ocean tides – in New Zealand, Alaska or Antarctica; or 4) heating and cooling of the Earth over days and seasons and years. Models will be compared with precise GPS or GNSS coordinate time series. The three-dimensional variations in Earth structure will be informed by recent breakthroughs in seismic tomography.
Candidates will gain advanced skills in numerical modelling and geodetic data analysis and generic skills in communication, data analysis, problem solving, and critical thinking. There is substantial employment demand for both these specific and generic skills, within academia, industry, and government. The outputs of this project will eventually benefit all users of GPS and similar systems.

Multiport Power Converters,"DC nanogrids have been rapidly developing to deliver clean energy to non-electrified and offshore settings. DC nanogrids consist of renewable energy sources such as solar PV and fuel cells and energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors to provide energy efficiently and reliably. Unidirectional and bidirectional power converters are typically employed to integrate PV and battery and provide stable power to loads. This architecture offers greater control flexibility and easy implementation; however, resulting in high cost and low power density. Three port power converters with at least one bidirectional port are an optimal solution to overcome these shortcomings. However, designing three-port power converters featuring voltage control and power management of each port with a simple control strategy while achieving high efficiency, high reliability, and low cost is challenging. Therefore, finding an optimal commercially available solution is difficult. This project focuses on designing and developing novel three-port power converters topologies and control strategies with high efficiency, high power density and low cost. The project involves deriving, modelling, simulating, prototype building and experimental testing the proposed topologies to validate the performance.

Multiphysics HFDEM for calving of ice shelves,"The mass loss of Antarctic ice shelves will govern whether global sea levels rise 1.1 m by 2100 or 15 m by 2500. The fracture and calving process of icebergs accounts for almost 50% of mass lost from the Antarctic ice shelves. Thus, accurate representation of the fracture and calving process of the icebergs is the key to reduce uncertainties in the prediction of future sea level rise. However, it remains elusive and current predictions are based on simplified physics and do not reflect local stress – fracture interactions. The application of discrete element models has represented a substantial advance by allowing iceberg calving processes to be simulated explicitly but is prohibitively computational expensive when applied to the large spatial and timescales of Multiphysics thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) coupling Antarctic iceberg calving.
This project looks to revolutionise our ability to accurately predict the fracture and calving process of the Antarctic icebergs using a novel hybrid finite-discrete element method (HFDEM) through implementing a THM coupling model. The coupling model will first be calibrated against laboratory experiments on the deformation and fracture of ice samples conducted at Ice Mechanics Lab of IMAS and then be applied to the fracture and calving process of Totten Glacier and Denman Glacier in East Antarctica. Numerical modellings will focus on reproducing current spatial distribution of fracture on the ice shelves, then progress to simulate the change in modelled fracture distribution as the ice shelves thin and retreat under future global warming scenarios.
This project builds on a substantial body of work by Dr Hongyuan Liu’s team in developing and parallelizing HFDEM as an innovative and efficient numerical tool to model the fracture process of brittle materials and involves in collaborations with Dr Sue Cook at IMAS and Prof Matt King at ARC Centre of Excellence on Antarctic Science.

Modelling Pumped Hydro Storage Dynamics,"Power systems are transitioning rapidly to being based on renewable energy sources, with decreasing generation being sources from conventional generators. This will introduce challenges in terms of power system security and stability, and will require large amounts of new, dispatchable and flexible sources of generation and energy storage. Pumped hydro storage technology, currently the largest energy storage technology in power systems globally, will play a significant role in providing this system stability but will need to evolve and adapt in order to do so.
This project will develop dynamic models of hydraulics, waterway, turbine, machine and converter for a wide range of fixed and variable speed pumped hydro systems designs, operating in both turbining and pumping modes and in transition between modes. Models will be used to subsequently assess the dynamic performance capabilities of PHS systems in providing power systems ancillary services, and will develop novel control approaches for integration of PHS into 100% renewables based systems. The project will feature case-studies of the Tasmanian power system, incorporating future scenarios identified by Tasmanian industry, the Australian Energy Market Operator and in state government strategy and policy.

Mitigation of power system fault events,"This project forms part of the new ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centre for Energy Technologies for Future Grids, a commonwealth funded collaborative initiative between the University of Tasmania and five other major Australian universities, together with fifteen partner organisations from industry. The Training Centre will provide solutions for the problems associated with the transition from fossil-fuel-based and centralised power grids to the renewables-based and decentralised grids of the future. The successful applicant for this project will be provided with opportunities to work as part of the broader training centre team, will work on problems of immediate relevance to industry and will have direct links to and be supported by industry partners.
As high grid penetration of renewable energy (RE) sources reduces system inertia, leading to potential instability, this research project will explore how to handle the generator coherency appropriately during the fault events. Intentional Controlled Islanding (ICI) involves splitting a power system into several self-healing islands as the last protective solution to avoid blackout after a large disturbance. ICI can help limit cascading fault events and avoid wide-area blackouts. Identification of coherent generators (CGs) is necessary for the area-based monitoring and protection system of a wide-area power system and will be investigated in this project. Synchrophasors have enabled smarter monitoring and control measures to be devised; hence, measurement-based methodologies can be implemented in online applications to identify the CGs. As a next step, sophisticated controlled islanding can be designed, which can help to limit cascaded outage. Finding the separation boundaries and stabilising the created islands are two aspects of the ICI problem that will be investigated.

Microplastics in Tasmanian soils,"Microplastics entering natural ecosystems has been a long recognised problem. In many cases the exact amount of microplastics being introduced into the food chain cannot be confirmed and the final effects are yet to be determined. While the topic has been extensively research in relation to marine environment there are still many gaps in understanding how microplastics enters the soil and what the consequences of that on general soil chemistry and physics as well as effect on the food chain are.
This research project is dedicated to identifying the microplastics component in Tasmanian soils and proposing the most efficient method for removing plastic particles from the soil. The research will be based on getting the thorough understanding of the processes involved in microplastics being introduced to soil and the chain of changes as the articles go through the processes of being absorbed by soil microorganisms and plants. The experimental component will be based on testing soil samples collected from different locations in Tasmania to determine the exact content of microplastics. The computer modelling part will be concerned with the propagation of micro-plastics in the ground, absorptions by plant and the progression in the food chain.
The final outcome of the project will be a theoretical framework and model for microplastics in Tasmanian soils which can be extended to other locations and provide the basis for the design and prototype of equipment to remove microplastics particles from affected soils.

Mitigation of Geohazard Risks for Debris Flow,"Heavy rainfall and a changing climate have a direct correlation with the frequency of large geohazard events. Heavy rain events are particularly challenging in the mountainous regions of the Tasmanian West Coast Wilderness. Two major categories of geohazards with the potential to cause catastrophic damage to the Tasmanian West Coast Wilderness Railway are rockfall and debris flow, posing a direct threat to human life and critical railway infrastructure.
The primary objective of this research is to reduce risk and mitigate rockfall and debris flow failure hazards. To assess a range of potential risk mitigation measures using large deformation geomechanical methods, advanced numerical methods such as the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and the Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian (CEL) method will be used to model geohazard behaviour, quantify the risks to railway infrastructure and develop innovative protective rockfall and debris flow barriers. The project aims to assess the performance of protective structures such as rockfall netting, rockfall shelters, check dams and debris flow barriers and develop sustainable engineering solutions. The proposed research project will focus on large deformation numerical simulation of soil-structure and fluid-structure interactions to address and mitigate rockfall and debris-flow risks. The project will improve the understanding of rockfall and debris flow behaviour, building on current geohazard risk assessment techniques to determine best-case measures for railway infrastructure protection.

GIA in the Denman Glacier region,"The Earth continues to deform following past changes in glacial loading and unloading, notably since the Last Glacial Maximum. The Denman Glacier region shows surprisingly low rates of present-day uplift and this is yet to be explained by models of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), the ongoing response of the solid Earth to ice-ocean loading changes. This gap in knowledge affects estimates of present-day ice mass change (and hence sea-level change) as GIA is an essential correction to satellite datasets of ice-sheet change.
This project will focus on modelling the deformation of the Denman Glacier region based on new ice history and relative sea-level data, new GPS bedrock velocities, and numerical models of glacial isostatic adjustment and sea-level processes.
The project will focus on creating three-dimensional reconstructions of ice history, with a focus on the late Holocene and using these as inputs into models of GIA, and then comparing these models to RSL and GPS observations from the region. The outputs of the project are an improved model of GIA for this region, validated by independent data, and new estimates of present-day ice-mass change by applying the new model to satellite datasets.

Improving indoor environmental quality,"Buildings are becoming increasingly data rich environments with a wider range of sensors and real time information being available to support management decisions. Much of this data is, however, considered in isolation based on their primary purposes of use (for example controlling ventilation) and generally investigated in a reactive manner to address issues that arise. This project will focus on leveraging this data in a proactive manner to support decision to improve the indoor environmental quality of buildings. Improved indoor environmental quality has been shown to increase occupant satisfaction, improve productivity, and reduce absenteeism and sick leave (improving well being).
This project will be completed in collaboration with UTAS facilities management and will develop decision making support tools like Indoor Environmental Quality indices will be trialed at UTAS to enhance the management of indoor spaces. While this project is firmly rooted in the Tasmanian context, the techniques and learnings from this project will be broadly applicable and of use to the broader engineering and facility management community.

This research project will explore the impact of variable outputs of renewable energy (RE) systems (solar and wind) combined with the ramp-rate constraints of thermal electricity generators on the stability of power grids. The project will also consider various storage technologies, which have great potential for smoothing supply from RE sources and to ensure it matches demand. While battery storage technologies can begin discharging power very quickly, fuel cells need time to warm-up and ramp-up their output. Furthermore, when electricity demand is low, the ramping down of demand needs to match with the ramping up of charging rates to store energy for later use in pumped hydro, H2 and battery energy storage facilities. This project will develop a coordinated algorithm for ramp-rate control of H2/battery/pumped storage for quickly adjusting to small changes in demand or supply. A model predictive control (MPC) will be designed to appropriately manage the ramp rates for different storage systems.

Numerical modelling of timber drying process,"Timber, being a natural cellular material, has significant inhomogeneity and anisotropic properties. However, in order for the timber to become a viable building material, it must be dried so that all the free moisture and some of the moisture in the cells have to be removed. This is very difficult process to predict, and previous experimental work can only give a very approximate empirical guidelines. The purpose of this project is to use state-of-the-art finite element software like commercial program COSMOL or locally developed Lattice Boltzmann program with appropriately devised constitutive model to give a better understanding of the drying process of timber so as to devise a more cost-effective, energy and time saving strategy for the process.

Evaluate resilience endemic conifers,"Tasmania hosts a number of endemic Gondwanan species that live for hundreds to thousands of years.  These species have been instrumental in developing long climate reconstructions for the Southern Hemisphere. The reconstructions are heavily based on statistical evidence of seasonal climate sensitivity, but evidence suggests that reliance on these statistical approaches may be in critical need of reappraisal.  Additionally, contemporary changes in climate that are likely to impact plant growth in ways that are not currently fully understood. These impacts may include threats to long- or short-term resilience of species.  To improve our understanding of the implications of these changes on growth and to also improve interpretation of the palaeoclimate record available from these trees, much finer resolution information on growth response to climate is required.
This interdisciplinary PhD project will span palaeoclimatology and plant physiology. It aims to improve our understanding of the responses of tree species to climate, including responses to climate extremes, through high-resolution monitoring of growth across multiple sites and species. The successful applicant will work with a palaeoclimatologist (Geography, Planning and Spatial Sciences: (https://www.utas.edu.au/technology-environments-design/geography-and-spatial-sciences) to apply new understanding to climate reconstructions from the properties of tree-rings of these species and with a plant physiologist (Plant Science, in Biological sciences: https://www.utas.edu.au/natural-sciences/biological-sciences ) to interpret impacts of climate on the species and their geographical distributions. Through this project, the successful applicant will develop high level programming and statistical analysis skills, the ability to obtain detailed physiological information from plants. By traversing traditional disciplinary boundaries, the successful applicant will also develop a broad collaborative network that can be expected to provide multiple avenues for further work.

Enhanced Pump as Turbine (PAT) Design,"The abundance of water resources and mountainous terrain of Tasmania make hydropower advantageous for both large- and small-scale power generation.  Micro scale pump as turbines (PATs) are a cost effective and versatile hydropower technology used for generating electricity on a smaller scale from water from a dam or river, or from an industrial process where they can replace a pressure reducing valve to recover energy that would be otherwise wasted. Micro scale PATs may also be connected to existing water storages to store and generate energy as required, effectively providing a micro-scale pumped storage hydropower system. This project investigates the performance enhancement of conventional PATs using two recent developments in technology. Replacement of the pump rotor with an optimised 3D printed rotor will improve hydraulic efficiency and provide frequency-based speed control. A wide range of materials may be 3D printed, including metal components. In addition, recent advances in power electronics now allow frequency-based speed control, which will allow for control of turbine speed and power output. These enhancements will significantly improve the performance of micro-scale PATs and bring benefit to the local renewable energy industry in Tasmania.

Engineered timber and indoor air quality,"Engineered timber products offer many advantages for construction, providing sufficient performance to replace steel and concrete in some applications with the advantage of being produced from a renewable resource and serving as a carbon sink. Current research conducted at the University of Tasmania focuses on developing new structurally reliable engineered wood products (EWPs) from sawn boards recovered from the available plantation hardwood estate in Tasmania, which improves industry efficiency as it allows material currently chipped for pulp and paper to be converted into much more valuable, manufactured products. However, while gaining in popularity both as structural and decorative elements in buildings, these materials have been demonstrated to be a significant contributor to volatile organic compounds in indoor environments and concerns have been raised about the impacts on indoor air quality and building occupants.
This project will investigate the impact of decisions made during manufacturing (e.g. glue and species selection) and application (e.g. coatings, exposed surfaces) on the type and magnitude of off-gas emissions from these products. Specific focus will be placed on the nature and dynamics of these emissions and understanding their importance in the context of other emission sources in the indoor environment. Outcomes from this project will support the development of guidance for industry to improve the production and application of these materials and reduce the potential for adverse impacts on indoor air quality and building occupants.

Digital twin model microwave food processing,"This research is to develop a digital twin computer simulation of the interaction of microwave and thermal energy on the heating of food products as they pass through a MATS microwave assisted thermal sterilisation system. The model will use a finite-element analysis approach utilising engineering modelling software accounting for spatial variation in the electric field due to resonance and phase interactions as well as the thermal capacitance and thermal conductivity properties of the foods. The purpose is to predict the heating patterns of packaged foods of varying shapes and dielectric properties as a function of the applied microwave radiation volumetric heating and hot water thermal conductive heating.
The research will require a review of the engineering software options for modelling such as a comparison of Comsol
This research is to broaden the economic base from food exports by producing higher value shelf stable ready meals that can be exported without refrigeration. Each food product behaves differently with microwaves generating  the potential for hot spot burning at the high energy input levels required for rapid throughput of product in a continuous microwave processing system.  A digital twin model is therefore a critical step towards optimising large scale manufacturing of heat sterilised products using MATS by enabling advance design and process optimisation studies to be conducted virtually in advance of experimental engineering. Graduates in this field will be skilled in predictive modelling and optimisation engineering for a career in applying Industry 4.0 technologies.

Development of a novel thermal and electrical energy storage system,"Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, have vast potential to offer a cost-competitive energy supply and reduce dependence on fossil fuels and environmental issues. However, the intermittent and uncertain nature of wind and solar power systems has led to a mismatch between energy supply and demand. There has been an increased demand for the deployment of the energy storage system (ESS) as an essential component of future energy systems adopting large amounts of variable renewable sources. Unfortunately, the need for ESS often introduces economic, environmental and complexity concerns. Developing an ESS balancing cost, efficiency and environmental impact is the main goal of this proposal.
This project aims to develop a novel thermal or electrical energy storage system according to renewable energy sources and users’ demands. It includes thermal energy storage, compressed air energy storage and battery energy storage. The research focuses on the thermal aspects of these energy storage systems. The research objectives involve fundamental theoretical and experimental studies to provide engineers and researchers future direction of the application of such energy storage systems in renewable sectors.

Novel model for rock dynamic fracture,"The prediction of the dynamic fracture of brittle materials such as rock and concrete is of major importance in engineering and materials science since it is involved in a wide range of applications, which include the design of safe and resilient structures exposed to impact, explosive loading or crash events; the optimisation of efficient and reliable rock drilling and blasting techniques for accessing deep underground; and the development of protective and durable materials. In recent decades, a huge effort was made to develop novel, efficient and accurate computational methods for investigating the fracture. Although an enormous progress has been made, the dynamic fracture induced by impact loads is worthy of further studies.
This project continues the efforts of the computational geomechanics team led by Dr Hongyuan Liu in developing a hybrid finite-discrete element method and parallelizing it on the basis of heterogeneous CPU and GPU parallel computation as an innovative and efficient numerical tool for investigating the dynamic fracture of brittle materials under impact loads. Digital twins of unconfined and confined split Hopkinson pressure bar testing apparatus are first established using the hybrid finite-discrete element method to investigate the dynamic fracture of rocks under impact loads. The project will then investigate rock fragmentation by blast in deep underground with high in-situ stress and resultant fragment debris and mixing behaviours in subsequent transferring points.
Successful PhD candidates are to be rewarded additionally with the opportunity of collaborating Dr Daisuke Fukuda in Hokkaido University Japan for further developing and parallelizing the hybrid finite-discrete element method and Dr Ewan Sellers and Dr Ebrahim Fathi Salmi at CSIRO for practical engineering applications.

DC Nanogrids for Off-grid Communities,"Standalone solar photovoltaic (PV) home system is a flexible and simple solution to provide electricity to off-grid communities, however, it has limited energy and power for productive use; therefore, the solution is incomplete and incomparable to grid-like solutions. Microgrids as an alternative solution can deliver reliable power and abundant energy, however, the present microgrids are based on centralised architectures and control, resulting in many drawbacks in terms of scalability, power delivery, and distribution efficiency. In addition, microgrids are not suitable for low population density and dispersed households communities due to high capital and operational cost.
DC nanogrid is an economical and efficient solution to deliver clean energy to off-grid rural and regional communities. This research project aims to design and develop a modular and decentralised off-grid solar photovoltaic and battery energy storage based DC nanogrid system to deliver reliable and robust electrification in off-grid settings among households. The study focuses on modelling and controlling an optimal architecture consisting of interconnected groups of nanogrids (households), where each nanogrid can work self-sufficiently while supporting the network and sharing resources with the neighbouring community.

Techno-economic Energy System Modelling,"This PhD project will develop appropriate techno-economic models for the Tasmanian energy system, including its interaction with the NEM, in order to analyse a wide range of likely future scenarios and their implications. Other prominent research groups around Australia and internationally have, in recent years, developed models designed for projecting outcomes under different policy or pricing scenarios or for demonstrating technology mix required to achieve different levels, generally up to 100%, of renewable energy generation in the system. Most or all of these are based on energy-balance modelling on hourly time-intervals with demand projections based on current trajectories. The proposed project introduces several areas of novelty and originality, including the consideration of generation and storage technology characteristics and their role in meeting short-term power system requirements as constraints in addition to their role in balancing energy supply /  demand, and inclusion of key aspects of energy market modelling, and will consider future scenarios which make provision for a significant transition to or increase in flexible loads such as electrified transport, hydrogen synthesis for large-scale domestic or export markets, and for direct export of energy via intra-regional transmission interconnects.

Battery thermal energy management in electric vehicles,"Transportation electrification is a novel green industrial revolution to tackle the transportation emission issues. The booming electric vehicle (EV) industry stimulates the development of onboard rechargeable power battery technologies towards a target of higher specific power & energy, greater safety & reliability, more environmental friendliness as well as increasing affordability. On the other hand, the revolutionary progress in battery technologies also drives the rapid development of the EV industry. In recent years, the lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells are favoured by many EV giants including Tesla, General Motors, Honda, Ford, Nissan, BMW, and BYD etc... Studies have shown that LIB cells can cycle more than 2000 times during 1C charging and discharging. With the rocketing specific energy and power values of modern battery technologies, the heat generation rates of the power battery packs increase rapidly. Although the theoretical operating temperature range of LIB is from -10 to +50°C, the optimal operating temperature range is 15 to 35°C as recommended in a report by Pesaran et al. from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). In addition, the temperature difference between different battery cells within a battery pack should be lower than 5°C. Much research verified that the battery degradation rate and aging phenomenon would be accelerated when the battery temperature was over 50 °C. This is a big challenge for batteries to cope with the extreme ambient temperatures or the abusive heat generations during fast charging/ discharging without compromising cycle life and output performance. As a result, to tackle the challenges of extreme ambient temperatures and heat generations during normal or abuse operations, an appropriate battery thermal management system (BTMS) is crucial and necessary to maintain optimal operating temperature range, improve durability, and prolong the life cycle. This project aims to develop and investigate different battery management systems used in EVs.

Anelastic Modelling of Antarctica,"The Earth beneath is constantly changing shape due to phenomena such as earthquakes, glacial melting and even the tides. Small deformations in the Earth's surface (of the millimetre or even sub-millimetre scale) can now be measured due to the advent of precise GPS positioning technologies. In recent years, the theories underpinning these deformations have lagged behind the observations, necessitating the development of advanced numerical models capable of simulating Earth-scale deformation.  Seismic data indicates there are large variations in the viscosity of the mantle beneath Antarctica. This variability can affect the accuracy of models such as the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), which are used to correct satellite measurements of ice mass change.
Focusing on ongoing deformation of Antarctica, this project will further develop advanced three-dimensional large strain finite element models of the Earth, incorporating heterogeneous structural properties and viscoelastic behaviour to examine geomechanical processes underpinning Earth-scale deformation and deformation associated with one or more of these major forcings:
Models will be compared with precise GPS or GNSS coordinate time series.

Technology to Support CALD Learners,"Academic and professional literature both suggest that learners of all ages from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds require additional, targeted support, or scaffolding, in order to receive equitable access to high-quality education. Professional bodies, such as the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, provide guidance in terms of appropriate strategies to be used by teachers in support of CALD learners. However, given the specific, individual needs of these learners, learning and teaching situations in which a significant percentage of students are from diverse backgrounds place greater demands on teachers/lecturers and institutions.
This project aims to investigate the potential for technology to enhance the ability of teachers and institutions to support CALD learners, with a particular emphasis on technology-enhanced linguistic and cultural scaffolding. Applications are sought from potential candidates interested in researching the use of technology in primary, secondary, adult, and tertiary settings in Tasmanian or Australian contexts.

Teaching Humanities in Tasmanian Schools,"This research project aims to examine the impacts of teaching Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS) in Tasmanian schools, from Prep to Grade 10. We seek to explore three key questions: How readily have teachers been able to apply the Australian Curriculum's HASS knowledge and skills in their classrooms? Do teachers have the appropriate knowledge and skills to confidently teach Australian history, geography and civics and citizenship to students? How confident are teachers about integrating the three cross-curriculum priorities of Tasmanian Aboriginal Histories and Cultures, Sustainability, and Asia and Australia's Engagement with Asia into the HASS learning area?
This project aligns with the University of Tasmania's Strategic Plan (2019-2024) which encourages research that is distinctively Tasmanian and of national and international significance. It also responds to the CALE research aspiration to understand the characteristics, causes and consequences that contribute to the development of a modern national identity, in this case, a national identity shaped by the teaching of Australian history, geography and civics and citizenship in Tasmanian schools. Because this research will take place in Tasmanian schools, potential candidates must demonstrate recent knowledge and experience of the ACARA Humanities and Social Sciences curriculum in Tasmania or on the Australian mainland.

Motivational trajectories of primary school teachers for languages’ teaching,"Anglophone countries, including Australia, are moving towards increasing provision of languages education in the primary sector. Language learning can positively impact on literacy, maths and science achievement, enhance children’s social skills and empathy, and their appreciation of cultural diversity. It relates positively to problem solving, creative flexibility, fluency and originality. It may also safeguard against cognitive decline in older age. Learning languages other than English can enrich participation in multilingual Australia, where over 300 languages are spoken. Yet, attaining this full potential requires effective teaching. While the Federal Government recognises the value of early languages learning and all states have undertaken or are undertaking expansion and enhancement of languages provision across the school trajectory, Tasmania is the only state still with no language education policy. Teachers in Tasmania thus face unique challenges to their motivation for languages teaching. Teacher motivation has significant impact on learner outcomes, teacher well-being and teacher retention, and the effectiveness of teacher practice. Understanding teacher motivation thus has the potential to contribute to enhancing learner and teacher experiences in Tasmanian schools.
This project will adopt a mixed methods approach to provide a big picture understanding of the professional contexts and experiences of primary teachers teaching languages across Tasmania and an in-depth longitudinal understanding of how these contexts and experiences impact on their motivation for language teaching and how this motivation manifests in practice. Novice teacher motivation is particularly important to understand because this early stage is crucial in supporting long-term professional motivation.

Hydrogen integration into power systems,"This project forms part of the new ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centre for Energy Technologies for Future Grids, a commonwealth funded collaborative initiative between the University of Tasmania and five other major Australian universities, together with fifteen partner organisations from industry. The Training Centre will provide solutions for the problems associated with the transition from fossil-fuel-based and centralised power grids to the renewables-based and decentralised grids of the future. The successful applicant for this project will be provided with opportunities to work as part of the broader training centre team, will work on problems of immediate relevance to industry and will have direct links to and be supported by industry partners.
This research project will explore the integration of hydrogen production technologies in electrical power systems so as to enhance the development and integration of both large scale renewable energy development and large scale hydrogen development, to ensure reliable and secure system operation. The project will develop appropriate models of alkaline and PEM electrolyser and converter technologies and through simulation will evaluate their impact in power systems, using the Tasmanian power system as a case-study. The project will develop operations and control methodologies for hydrogen electrolysis plants so that they can be operated in power systems that are characterised by large scale renewable energy generation. As part of this project you will be supported and mentored by renewable energy development company UPC\AC Renewables along with global consultant GHD, and will spend time embedded within these organisations as part of the PhD program.

Learning analytics informed course design,"UTAS has long been catering for regional and remote students through online and blended courses. The current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has seen an even greater development of such course offerings across Australia. However, overall universities have observed higher student attrition rates and disengagement among these student cohorts. There is an urgent need for universities to rethink their course design and support strategies to enhance student engagement and retention. To address this significant issue, this project will use an innovative and comprehensive response, by integrating Garrison, Anderson and Archer’s (2000) Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework and emerging data analytics techniques. It will seek to identify strategies that are currently used in online and blended courses/units to engage and retain students, and develop a support framework for best pedagogical practices to build and foster a Community of Inquiry (CoI), to maximise student engagement and retention.

Innovating Digital Technologies,"Digital Technologies is one of the key subjects for F-10 students with new and unique skills and content to be addressed in the Australian Curriculum. Access to and participation in education experiences that utilise digital technologies to foster digital literacies, competence and confidence is acknowledged as a key determinant for overcoming socio-economic complexities in Tasmania.
This research project seeks to investigate teachers' approaches to using Digital Technologies (DT), specifically Education Technology (Edu Tech) and Extended Reality (XR). The project's approach to research-creation synergises with the two strands of the Digital Technologies learning area of the Australian Curriculum; these being (a) generate knowledge and understanding; and (b) develop processes and production skills.
This PhD project seeks candidates who are ready to engage in experimental research-creation to explore, examine and develop innovations for interactive educational prototyping. Leveraging traditional and non-traditional research-creation methodologies, PhD candidates will be supported to investigate and contribute innovations that can support enactment of DT curriculum and pedagogy. We are particularly interested in recruiting candidates keen to explore and contribute Edu Tech and XR innovation for K-12 settings.
This research-creation oriented project is especially keen to promote learning, discovery and connection making between specialist and non-specialist DT teachers and teaching. Examples of anticipated outcomes of this PhD project include:

Using localised smart sensing for eHealth solutions in post-COVID work environments,"PhD project proposals are being appraised by the UTAS Active Work Lab cross-disciplinary research team for consideration to expand our investigation into the effectiveness of eHealth strategies for educating the public about health behaviour change. The lab is dedicated to developing and using eHealth strategies to address unhealthy work behaviours, such as prolonged sitting. Recently, COVID-19 has changed the office work environment. Many employees now and will, for the foreseeable future, work remotely. To date, it appears that remote working environments adversely affect a range of health indices. The COVID-19 health crisis has created a need for innovative, sustainable, modifiable, eHealth solutions to address the physical inactivity pandemic that persists in the 21
Thus, our ongoing work will encompass PhD project proposals which use persuasive technology strategies to improve employee adherence to and compliance with healthy behaviour initiatives. A multi-disciplinary lens, utilising experts from the fields of educational psychology, digital programming, and workplace health will be available to help promising applicants personalise a project that identifies relevant variables for investigation. During this project, a localised smart sensing system will be developed, deployed, and tested on national sample of data to be compared to our local Tasmanian findings so we can tailor marketable, global eHealth solutions that include the physical, mental, and social health considerations for geographically neutral employees.

Building vision in the language classroom,"Vision building in the language classroom is well established as an effective means of generating and sustaining language learning motivation. As learners strengthen and concretise their identities as users of the language, they attach greater meaning to language learning, positively impacting on their motivation and engagement. Nevertheless, this concrete vision is particularly elusive in classrooms where exposure to the language-speaking community is rare if not non-existent and where the context of learning is far removed from the supposed context of language use. Extended reality teaching offers a unique means of bringing authenticity into task-based teaching and of creating rich opportunities for intercultural experiences. In doing so it offers unprecedented opportunities for learners to envisage, enact and reflect on their language identities. Yet, their potential for  supporting meaningful school-based experiences of language learning and to mitigate the motivational challenges often encountered in these settings is vastly under-researched.
This project seeks suitable candidates interested in examining the potential of extended reality for generating, strengthening, and sustaining learners’ identities as users of a second language and as global citizens. The project will explore the ways in which Extended Reality applications can enrich the language learning context, enhance the authenticity of language learning tasks, and create opportunities for interactive, intercultural learning experiences. Furthermore, the impact on vision building, learner identity development, and motivation will be investigated in order to strengthen current theoretical and practical understandings in this field.

Inverter responses during system faults,"This project forms part of the new ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centre for Energy Technologies for Future Grids, a commonwealth funded collaborative initiative between the University of Tasmania and five other major Australian universities, together with fifteen partner organisations from industry. The Training Centre will provide solutions for the problems associated with the transition from fossil-fuel-based and centralised power grids to the renewables-based and decentralised grids of the future. The successful applicant for this project will be provided with opportunities to work as part of the broader training centre team, will work on problems of immediate relevance to industry and will have direct links to and be supported by industry partners.
This research project will investigate the response and interaction of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs - solar, wind, battery and EV charger inverters) under fault conditions in modern power systems.  In power systems with increasing penetration of renewables and IBRs, operation of the low voltage ride-through (LVRT) responses of IBRs in LV/MV networks involves a plant injecting reactive power via reactive power-voltage droop control, according to voltage measured at the inverter terminal. While this is designed to support power system voltage, it can cause overvoltage in all phases or in one or more phases in the case of unbalanced faults, particularly in systems operating under low system strength conditions. Under current approaches, after the LVRT response trigger is subsequently removed voltage can again drop and trigger a subsequent LVRT response. The reactive power contribution from IBRs should, in contrast, ideally be optimised based on the voltage level at the plant's point of connection, upstream network characteristics, and fault type and severity. This research will investigate network issues related to LVRT operation and develop mitigation strategies that will solve the hunting issue for the set-point of LVRT. An intelligent algorithm will be developed to tune the LVRT control loop so as to better support voltage under fault conditions in weak power grids and to avoid overvoltage and LVRT retriggering.

Wellbeing and the Good Life,"Wellbeing is a complex, multidimensional construct that is affected by an array of individual and structural factors. There is, however, an emerging literature that suggests that there are practices that individuals can engage in to enhance their sense of wellbeing. After systematically analysing this and related literatures, this PhD project will explore how these practices can be applied in the Tasmanian context and whether, how and for how long engaging in these practices increases individual-level wellbeing.
The project will contribute to the knowledge of wellbeing by examining the various mechanisms through which individual behaviour does (and does not) increase individuals’ sense of wellbeing. Accordingly, the findings will have implications for policy and practice.

Foundation Design of Tidal Turbines,"Tidal current turbine technologies have yet to converge on a single design concept, in contrast to wind turbine technologies. As a result, numerous moored and rigid turbine technologies exist for various water depths and tidal currents. Regardless of the technology, turbines must be supported on a foundation in a reliable and practical way. The construction, installation and maintenance of foundation systems form a significant part of the overall life-cycle cost of the tidal energy project. The success of the project depends on accurately predicting and designing the response of the foundation and the interaction with seabed geomaterials. Despite the ongoing growth of geotechnical engineering in foundation system design for residential, transportation, mining and wind energy infrastructures, design methods for tidal current turbine foundations are relatively undeveloped, using the most basic of geotechnical parameters, derived from qualitative geological investigations. Such methods are overly conservative, leading to unnecessarily expensive designs. This project addresses the need for improved design methods in clayey marine sediments, through state-of-the-art numerical approaches, employing advanced large deformation simulation methods coupled with realistic constitutive soil models.
Advanced numerical simulation techniques will model offshore structure-seafloor interactions through appropriate constitutive models of marine sediment response. The project aims to discover the underlying mechanical soil characteristics and processes controlling the bearing capacity of tidal current turbine foundations, and the effect of disturbance in the vicinity of the foundation developed during installation on the bearing capacity.

Critical citizenship in TESOL classrooms,"With almost one third of the population born overseas, Australia is a key immigration destination in the Asia-Pacific region, yet difficulties in information access during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted a social disconnect and isolation among immigrant communities. Language and citizenship are widely argued to exist in a symbiotic relationship. Through language, societies define and delimit membership, and individuals access and exercise rights and enact civic participation. TESOL sits in this nexus, yet few studies have examined the role of language learning programmes in navigating convergences and tensions between existing and emerging notions and practices of citizenship. This qualitative, longitudinal study will uncover the experiences of ESL students and their teachers engaged in migrant English language programmes to develop rich understanding of TESOL classrooms as citizenship development sites and of the role TESOL teachers play in this process.  The study will empirically extend theory on the language and citizenship relationship and expand knowledge regarding TESOL teachers’ multi-faceted roles in largely under-explored directions. It will also generate insights for community,for policy on migrant programmes and for TESOL teacher educators.

Hyperspectral Mineralogy & Geochemistry,"Hyperspectral mineralogy mapping is a popular and rapidly evolving technique in the field of economic geology. This is primarily because data collection is fast and non-invasive and the resulting outputs can be used to predict mineralogy at multiple scales. However, prompt and reliable hyperspectral data interpretation is still a challenging task as the relationship between spectral anomalies and subtle changes in mineral chemistry is poorly understood.
The University of Tasmania, Australia, is seeking a highly motivated PhD candidate for a research project that focuses on:
A variety of analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, Short Wavelength Infra-Red (SWIR) spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) will be used to help determine the cause of the spectral anomalies. The outcomes will provide opportunities to develop methods and workflows to upscale mineralogy information from the microscopic (<1 cm) to macroscopic scale (hundreds of meters to kilometres) to aid mineral exploration and ore processing.
This project would be conducted as part of the AMIRA P1249 project: 'Exploring, characterising, and optimising complex orebodies – Integrated deposit knowledge to add value across the Mining Value Chain.' The candidate will work with a large research team at University of Tasmania and collaborate with a large industry sponsor group. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to conduct geological fieldwork at one or more of the P1249 study sites to obtain sample material for this project. P1249 also has an extensive sample archive from porphyry copper and epithermal gold deposits that will be drawn on for comparative analyses.

Critical metals from legacy mine wastes,"Critical metals are vital, scarce resources required for modern technology, infrastructure and the transition to a renewable energy future. In order to address global supply issues, growth in critical metal resources and advances in their extraction technologies are required. One potential pathway to critical metals production involves recovery of critical metal resource streams from areas already impacted by mining, in particular through waste reprocessing from historical and legacy mine waste facilities. Economic recovery of critical metals from mine wastes has the potential to improve environmental sustainability through the responsible use of resources, enhance the value of mining operations and minimise environmental footprints, thereby significantly benefiting regional and rural communities and the environment whilst also growing critical metals inventory.
This PhD project will develop novel methods of characterising and processing critical metals from one or more historic or legacy mine waste facility in Western Tasmania. Primary focus will be on cobalt, ranked 6th on Geoscience Australia's (GA's) list of critical metals, with other critical metals to be considered if present in significant amounts.

Dynamics of Future Offshore Feed Pipes,"In the development of sustainable offshore farming solutions for salmon aquaculture, salmon feed represents a major cost of business. Tonnes of feed per day can be delivered from feed barges to the individual pens, using sophisticated monitoring and remote feeding control systems. Salmon feed pellets are conveyed from feed barges to individual pens using High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipes. Current arrangements for these pipes and their connections may be unsuitable for future more exposed sites, especially in the case of bad weather.  Damage to individual feed pipes and/or disorder in the feed pipe bundles may result from the greater relative movement of the different parts of the feed system, leading to substantial maintenance requirements and costs. This project aims to investigate the major aspects controlling the performance and operation of feed pipe systems for open, floating, flexible fish pen systems, with the specific objective of improving the design of feed pipe systems to be used in future high-energy sites.
Funded by the Blue Economy CRC, the proposed research project will model specific structural components of aquaculture feed pipe systems. The research aims to assess pipe system dynamics and potential maintenance requirements in high-energy hydrodynamic offshore environments. The research will focus on pipe structural behaviour, feed pipe arrangements and bundling systems, and the loads imposed by wind, waves, and currents. As a result of the research, models will be developed to help design sustainable engineering solutions for feed pipe systems to be used in future offshore salmon aquaculture.

Characterisation of skarn-type deposits,"Critical metals are vital, scarce resources required for modern technology, infrastructure and the transition to a renewable energy future. In order to address global supply issues, growth in critical metal resources and advances in their extraction technologies are required. One of the most important critical metals is tungsten (W), which is ranked #4 in Geoscience Australia’s (GA) critical metals list and is classified as having ‘high criticality’. Western Tasmania has significant W resources in skarn deposits, including Dolphin (King Island), and Kara (Somerset) and other critical metals such as tin (e.g., Renison) and Ni (e.g., Avebury).

3D geological and geophysical modelling,"A large, long-running project developing software for probabilistic 3D geological and geophysical modelling, LOOP 3D, is now well advanced with a range of Python code libraries.  It promises to enable automatic creation of 3D geological models directly from geological observations such as contacts and structural measurements.  The code has been tested with success in a range of terranes, but has yet to be demonstrated in complex geology such as the mineralised Dundas Trough of western Tasmania.  This project addresses that research challenge, using the region in the vicinity of the Hellyer and Que River VMS deposits in NW Tasmania.
The 3D model(s) developed will be tested in the Loop environment using geophysical data (particularly potential field.  Some code development to incorporate inversion results may be required to facilitate this.  In addition to modelling existing geophysical data (mainly potential field), ambient seismic noise tomography is proposed with the student deploying an array of seismometers covering the Hellyer ore deposit and encompassing a broad spectrum of Tasmanian Geology, for example lithologies associated with the Cambrian Mt Read Volcanics and Proterozoic Rocky Cape Group (please see accompanying map).

The economics of weather,"Economic activities in a wide range of sectors including agriculture, energy, fisheries and tourism are substantially influenced by weather conditions. Quality weather forecasts are thus crucial for many businesses to prioritize optimal actions in response to expected weather events, but assessments of weather forecasts are often based on statistical measures of forecast accuracy that are independent to its economic values.   What is missing, is way of forecasting weather to support important sectors.
A core strategic goal of UTAS is to improve environmental sustainability and economic outcomes. This project contributes to that goal by linking methods to improve weather forecasts and to use weather information for sector specific decision making. With a long track record in both natural resource economics and time series forecasting, COBE researchers possesses the expertise to support the project. Successful candidate(s) will undertake research in one or more of the following areas: economics of information, weather and renewable energy, weather and fisheries and aquaculture, probability forecasting, forecast evaluation.

Speech movement and dementia risk,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) accounts for 70% of dementia cases. There are three stages of AD: preclinical AD (pre-AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. Pre-AD describes a phase where AD pathology progresses, for about 10-15 years, before cognitive signs of dementia appear. There is therefore an urgent, unmet need for low cost, accessible population-level tests to detect AD pathology across this continuum, with a particular focus on pre-AD. Cognitive tests lack sensitivity until the MCI stage. Specialist biomarkers (cerebrospinal fluid and blood tests, brain scans) can detect pre-AD changes, but they are expensive, invasive, and not suitable for population-level screening. Substantial research has documented gait changes in pre-AD, and recently that changes in the speed and variability of repetitive hand movements appear sensitive to pre-AD pathology. Complementing this, changes in the speed, rhythm, and accuracy of lip, tongue, and palatal movements, in isolation and combination (syllabic diadochokinesis [DDK]) may be a biomarker of cognitive decline, with age-related changes in sensory, motor and language systems impairing cognitive processing and task performance. DDK has been used for some time in diagnosing and monitoring functional decline in progressive neurological disorders, such as dementia; however, DDK has never been investigated in pre-AD, nor assessed precisely using computer analysis. Typically, DDK tasks are audio-recorded, then played back for manual and subjective analysis of rate, rhythm, and accuracy. In this project, the student will work with a multidisciplinary team (speech pathologist, neurologist, computer scientist, physiotherapist, general practitioner) to (1) develop an online version of the clinical DDK test, (2) combine DDK analysis with already-developed online analysis of repetitive hand movements, and (3) analyse the performance of adults who do and do not have cognitive difficulties to determine which combinations of hand-speech movement data most accurately detect preclinical AD to provide a more sensitive and inclusive means for detecting early AD pathology.

Saving neurons from neurodegeneration,"Degeneration of neurons is the key cause of the functional changes in neurodegenerative disease such as those that cause dementia and motor neuron disease, resulting in the loss of the ability to think, speak, walk and swallow. We are investigating causes of neurodegeneration and treatment strategies to protect neurons. There is increasing evidence that different parts of the neuron, for example the cell body and the long processes known as axons, degenerate by different mechanisms. This means that a combination of more than one drug may be needed to protect neurons. This project will investigate whether there are axon-specific alterations in response to disease-related insults, as well as whether we can design combination therapies to protect both the cell bodies and the axons against degeneration. To investigate these aims, we will utilise the mouse visual system. The visual system is an ideal intermediary step between cell culture systems and transgenic animals. This is because neurons in the retina share important features with neurons affected in neurodegenerative diseases, but are much more accessible, and due to the organisation of the system allow axonal alterations to be examined.
The project will involve the use of well-characterised techniques including histology and molecular biology, as well as the development of novel techniques to measure changes in the axon, including viral transduction, multi-omics approaches, and bioinformatic analysis to investigate the aims. Together, this project will provide essential knowledge for how we can protect neurons in neurodegenerative disease and how new drugs should be targeted for providing neuroprotective strategies.

Assessing the efficacy of nudging techniques for prompting business start-ups,"During COVID-19, businesses have modified their operations to capitalise on online market opportunities, impacting labour market conditions. While this has made it more difficult to find traditional work, this online revolution has also created the opportunity for people to set up a business cost-effectively, i.e., without the need for investing in expensive bricks and mortar. However, incentives are required to encourage under and unemployed workers from traditional labour markets to start sustainable business ventures. One potential tool is to use behavioural science ‘nudging’ techniques, commonly applied to encourage people to make healthier or more sustainable choices, to prompt people to start their own business.
This project brings together the disciplines of entrepreneurship and behavioural economics to consider the efficacy of nudging techniques in encouraging business start-ups. The research focuses on Tasmania, a state with high underemployment in Australia and a high proportion of low paid/skilled jobs. The successful candidate will leverage insights from the nudging literature in relation to entrepreneurship to create prompts for particular cohorts, e.g., under and unemployed youth in regional areas, to start their own business. They will use survey methods to follow up on those participating in the nudge to monitor long-term effects on attitudes/behaviours.
The project will help identify whether and how nudges can be designed and applied to encourage under and unemployed workers to start sustainable business ventures. The outcomes will be of interest to agencies supporting sustainable business growth in regional and remote areas where traditional job opportunities are constrained.

Healthy ageing in Tasmanian communities,"Risk factors for dementia, including smoking, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity, and low levels of educational attainment are prevalent in Tasmania, as are low levels of literacy. Tasmania is also the oldest and among the fastest ageing population in the country. Without intervention, Tasmania will face a surge in dementia cases over the coming decades as the population ages particularly in at risk communities. Dementia incidence could be reduced by up to 40% by introducing health and lifestyle changes to reduce risk including more effective management of existing health conditions, improving diet and regular exercise, and maintaining social connections and lifelong learning.
As dementia risk factors overlap with other chronic conditions, this would improve overall health and wellbeing. Public health strategies are needed to help Tasmanians reduce their dementia risk. For any public health approach to be effective, it must reach the most at-risk members of the community, however many public health campaigns reach only those with sufficient literacy to engage. This project will take a proactive, integrated and co-design approach to distil new ways to improve health and health literacy through community consultation and co-design of the dementia risk reduction message in a form that is accessible, understandable, and actionable. We will evaluate the effectiveness of co-designed approaches on dementia risk reduction knowledge, motivation, and behaviour, as well as health literacy.

Regional collaboration for STEM pathways,"Critical metals are vital, scarce resources required for modern technology, infrastructure and the transition to a renewable energy future. To address global supply issues and support decarbonisation, growth in critical metal resources and advances in their extraction technologies are required. However, low community engagement with, and support for, the minerals industry impedes sustainable critical metal production in Tasmania. In the absence of social acceptance within community, the critical metal industry is impeded in its ability to mobilise an ongoing workforce, particularly in rural, regional and remote (RRR) areas. Similarly, a lack of understanding within RRR communities of the benefits of mining, its operations and needs, can result in the limited inclusion of engaging and placed-based learning activities within school curricula. Without young people being inspired to participate in contextualised science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) learning in school, they will not continue onto higher education study or be available to take advantage of the job opportunities in the minerals industry.
This PhD project will contribute to our understandings of how university-industry-community partnerships can be developed within RRR communities for mutually beneficial and sustainable outcomes for all stakeholders. It will include the development, trialling and research into the effectiveness of innovative educational and outreach tools and activities, in engaging RRR communities in STEM. Key community stakeholders will work with the candidate and project team to co-design and implement educational tools (e.g., immersive 3D visualisations of mining operations) and activities (e.g., STEM forums). Importantly, the research will identify ways in which placed-based curricula can inspire young people's interest in learning STEM in school and beyond.
This project will be conducted as part of a new CODES critical metals research initiative. The candidate will work in a multidisciplinary research team and collaborate with a large industry sponsor group.

Detect cognitive decline in Parkinson's,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurological disorder in the world, with age-standardized prevalence rates increasing by 22% in the last 20 years. Although PD was traditionally considered a pure movement disorder characterised by tremor and slowed walking, it is now recognised that PD has prominent non-movement features too. Specifically, by 15 years post-diagnosis, about 80% of people with PD (pwPD) have developed cognitive decline and 40% have dementia. PD cognitive decline substantially increases the risk of PD dementia but there are no precise low-cost methods to detect early cognitive decline; clinicians rely on insensitive pen-and-paper tests. There is an urgent need to address this gap, to facilitate early recruitment to clinical trials, especially as new evidence shows that lifestyle risk modification reduces PD dementia risk.
In this project, a multidisciplinary team (neurologist and neuroscientist) with strong collaborative links to computer scientists, will supervise the candidate to undertake a cross-sectional study comparing movement and cognition in pwPD (with and without cognitive decline) to age-matched controls from the ISLAND Project (the largest dementia prevention study in the world).  The candidate will work with established community PD groups to develop: (i) a database of pwPD in Tasmania; (ii) new computer technologies to precisely measure movement/cognitive features and (iii) a new phone app that records fluctuations in symptoms. We will develop new computer algorithms to identify the earliest stages of PD cognitive impairment by investigating which data patterns most strongly associate with cognitive impairment.  The outcome will be a new phone app that can be used remotely, at home and clinically, to detect clinical changes indicative of cognitive impairment. This builds upon the NHMRC-funded TAS Test project where >2,000 older adults have provided online movement and cognitive data, and harnesses strong links with the ISLAND Project, ISLAND Cognitive clinic, Parkinson's community groups and the Royal Hobart Hospital.

Evaluating TBI literacy in TBI MOOC participants,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often referred to as a silent epidemic and has recently been identified by the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) as a national priority. We know TBI occurs in higher rates in regional and remote areas with the outcomes of these individuals often being worse, due to a variety of factors including access to health care, rehabilitation services and general awareness. This project will assess the impact of the TBI massive open online course (MOOC) on awareness and understanding of TBI, to identify gaps in community knowledge that can lead to poor outcomes for individuals living with TBI. We will explore the use of innovative educational tools that include stories of lived experience to broaden Australians’ understanding of TBI. Education will cover the spectrum of injury from mild through to moderate-severe as well as the journey from the initial injury through to moving back into community.
Health literacy is defined as the knowledge and skills needed to find and use information for health decision making. Poor health literacy contributes to poorer health outcomes, given TBI occurs in higher numbers in rural and remote settings, this represents a significant challenge as health literacy levels are often low. This project will explore health literacy in the context of TBI and effectiveness of the MOOC.

Pathways to production - critical metals,"Critical metals are vital, scarce resources required for modern technology, infrastructure and the transition to a renewable energy future. In order to address global supply issues, growth in critical metal resources and advances in their extraction technologies are required. Tasmania has substantial critical metal resources (e.g., W, Co, Sn, Ni, Mg) with the potential to contribute significantly to growth in  critical metals inventory. Extraction of critical metals from ores and waste materials can be challenging and pose potential barriers to cost-effective recovery that need to be addressed. These include potential issues with crushing and grinding, separation of critical metals from gangue, and efficient energy use. These issues apply to extraction as by-products from operating metal mines and extraction from legacy waste materials. 
This project will be conducted as part of a new CODES critical metals research initiative. The candidate will work in a multidisciplinary research team and collaborate with a large industry sponsor group.

Dementia Care Workforce,"The aged care workforce is under pressure to care for clients with increasingly complex health conditions and multiple comorbidities, particularly dementia, a global public health issue.  Over half of Australian aged care home residents live with dementia. People living with dementia have high needs for care to support daily living and behaviour. It is vital that aged care staff can provide skilled, informed care to meet these complex needs, yet gaps have been found in staff dementia knowledge.  Therefore, it is important to explore workforce participation in education aiming to enhance dementia knowledge and the impact of such education on both understanding and agency to improve care quality.
This mixed methods project will use as a case study the Wicking Centre’s online Dementia Care Program, undertaken by students across Australia who are typically working in residential, home or community care. It will collect data on the impact of studying the Diploma and Bachelor of Dementia Care on students’ dementia knowledge, attitudes, care practices and career pathways. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected via online surveys administered at multiple time points. A subgroup of participants will be interviewed to obtain in-depth qualitative data on the impact of education on care practices, aged care leadership, and career pathways. This project will look at the role education can play in translation of dementia knowledge into practice in aged care. This includes how information is used to change current care practices, to advocate for broader care improvements, and the opportunity provided by education to move into different roles and career pathways. In this way, the project will explore some of the contributing factors that will need to be addressed by the aged care sector if they are to build and reshape their workforce to be more innovative and highly skilled in care delivery.

Addressing dementia literacy needs in Tasmania,"Health literacy is defined as the knowledge and skills needed to find and use information for health decision making. Poor health literacy contributes to poorer health outcomes, and, for Tasmania, this represents a significant challenge where health literacy levels are low.  Dementia is a major health challenge for Tasmania due to the aging population, prevalence of risk factors and poor access to many services. The majority of those living with dementia will continue to live within their communities, supported by family, friends and local services. Improved knowledge and awareness of dementia are fundamental to providing this support. The capacity to translate this knowledge about dementia into changed beliefs, attitudes, decision making and action about assessment, risk, diagnosis, access and use of health services for prevention, caregiving and support for people with dementia is critical. This can be described as dementia literacy.
The Wicking Centre has recently developed a new model of dementia literacy comprising knowledge, evaluation, engagement, readiness, social supports, specific dementia services, and practical needs. This project will examine dementia literacy in Tasmanian communities spanning geographical and socioeconomic divides. A proactive, integrated and co-design approach will be used to determine current dementia literacy levels, identify gaps, and distil new ways to improve dementia literacy through rural and remote community consultation.  Addressing dementia literacy needs in a form that is accessible, understandable, and actionable offers the best approach to equip Tasmanian communities to meet the challenge of dementia.

HLR for Health Professionals,"This is an interdisciplinary College of Health and Medicine project involving representation from all 5 Schools. The research responds to an existing gap in the literature, as little is understood about the health literacy responsiveness (HLR) of health and social care professionals and those studying to join such professions. Understanding the ability of health and social care professionals to respond appropriately to their clients' health literacy needs will be a key step in the challenge to support and improve the health literacy of Tasmanians. Further, understanding the effectiveness of current university education in the development of health literacy responsiveness in future professionals will inform curriculum development and improvements.
This mixed-methods project will investigate the current health literacy responsiveness of health and social care professionals via online surveys, along with a longitudinal survey of health and care student health literacy responsiveness as they progress through their education. The research involves investigation of tools to measure HLR, as validated tools do not yet exist. Healthcare professionals will be approached to provide rich qualitative data about their perceptions of the health literacy needs of their clients and their ability to meet these needs, along with perceptions of the extent to which they were prepared to respond to their clients' health literacy needs by their tertiary education.

Tongue strength and dementia,"Tongue strength and movement are critical for efficient chewing, swallowing, and speech production – and thus for assisting people with dementia to be well-nourished, able to communicate and engage socially, and maintain their health and wellbeing. Decreased tongue strength has been associated with both ageing and sarcopenia, a condition of progressive and generalised loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength. In recent years, sarcopenia has been recognised as a serious problem for older adults. This is particularly noteworthy for older adults with dementia.
Tongue strength is easily measured using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI) and computer-based tongue strengthening exercises are effective. Measuring tongue strength and implementing tongue strengthening exercises, when needed, can be a valuable strategy in maintaining the health and wellbeing of people with dementia.
The IOPI is a portable, hand-held device that records the pressure exerted by the tongue in kilopascals (kPa). A disposable bulb is placed in the mouth, behind the upper incisors. The adult is asked to push the bulb against the hard palate using the tongue as strongly as possible for 3 seconds. Three measures are taken. A 1-minute rest is given between each measure. The highest measured value is documented. There are normative data for healthy older adults.
Documenting the tongue strength of adults referred to the ISLAND Clinic will provide valuable data regarding any risk to nutritional health, swallowing safety, and speech production. Such data will be compared to measures of nutritional status (the Mini-Nutritional Assessment), ability to swallow 90 cc water without difficulty (the Yale swallow protocol), and a quality-of-life scale. Completion of these four measures will take no longer than 30 minutes. These data will complement protocols already in place, including gait and physical function, and enable evidence-based intervention to maintain the health and wellbeing of people with dementia.

Media representation and wellbeing,"Media representation of individuals and groups is understood by many to be empowering, and critical to building broader understanding of identities and practices that don't occupy space in mainstream cultural and creative texts. While much of the conversation about representation has typically involved audits of legacy media (in particular television), many argue that although social and participatory media seemed to promise more egalitarian access to representation, it reinforces existing power dynamics.
This project explores specifically the relationship between media representation and wellbeing. This can include the positive and negative aspects of media representation as understood by individuals/communities or audiences more broadly. What are the emergent types of representation? What are the impacts of representation? How is representation communicated?
We encourage applicants who wish to consider representation and its role in the current and emergent media landscapes. We encourage applicants who are interested in pursuing a particular case study of representation including but not limited to race, disability, class, ageing, sexuality, gender, and regional/rural identities.

"Communication, environment and conflict","Australia will enter its fifth decade as a signatory to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention in the wake of a series of disastrous events from bushfires to coral bleaching that significantly impact its natural and cultural heritage. Meanwhile, the centre of global population and trade continues to shift towards the Asia-Pacific, with increasing demand in the region for resources, food, homes and holidays.
In a world profoundly transformed by digital media, attacks on science and circulation of 'fake news' diminish trust in cultural institutions and political decisions, and journalists and campaigners for heritage and wildlife protection are increasingly the subject of violence across many parts of the Asia-Pacific.
Too often, communication – the fundamental way in which knowledge is transmitted and futures negotiated – becomes the means by which communities collide, when what is required is knowledge that bridges physical and social sciences, academic and non-academic cultures, Indigenous knowledge and the understandings of other stakeholders, women and men, young and old, urban and rural, developing and rich nations.
We encourage applicants interested in exploring ways of reducing community and transnational conflict within the context of environmental management.

How sound shapes the Antarctic experience,"This project aims to investigate the role of sound in shaping human perceptions and experiences of Antarctica. Since the earliest expeditions to Antarctica more than a century ago, environmental sounds have formed important aspects of human interactions with the southern continent. This is evident in the many references to sounds (including those produced by wildlife, wind, ice, and human activity) and silence found in expeditioners' diaries from the Heroic Age (c.1897–1922) and in more contemporary accounts of Antarctic travel.
While there has been considerable research undertaken in recent years in the Antarctic humanities on cultural texts, and preliminary studies relating to the role of the senses in human encounters with the Antarctic region, to date there has been little attention paid to the impact of the acoustic environment on experiences and perceptions of the continent, or how these have been incorporated into cultural responses to the region. Depending on background and interest, this project could focus on a particular periods, types of travellers (explorers, tourists, workers), and/or forms of sound (anthropogenic, environmental, sound art, music). Overall, this study is expected to advance knowledge of the multifaceted ways in which humans engage with Antarctica and how sounds can shape and add value to the Antarctic experience.

Synthetic molecules from natural products,"This project will develop efficient, scalable syntheses of valuable molecules from natural products extracted/isolated from Tasmanian native plants employing in-house-developed pressurised hot water extraction (PHWE) methodology. Original novel transition-metal-based catalysts will be designed and engineered to establish unprecedented chemical reactions to facilitate this research. In addition to providing enhanced access to bioactive, pharmaceutically-relevant compounds, the results of this project may create new strategies for the rapid and direct synthesis of important classes of molecules. The potential of these processes to establish new modes of small molecule activation and develop novel synthetic methodology will also be explored.
For example, the pharmaceutical drug galanthamine is one of four clinically-approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used to treat early- to mid-stage Alzheimer’s disease. Tasmania has one of the highest rates of this disease in Australia. This project will develop an efficient, scalable synthesis of galanthamine (and novel analogues) from opiates. Opiates, such as thebaine, are isolated from poppies and comprise a multi-billion-dollar global industry. For example, 240 tons of thebaine was manufactured worldwide in 2011 and Tasmania supplies ~45% of the World's opiate-based pharmaceuticals. The industry is worth ~$300m annually to the state and this project can add further value to the important local agriculture industry.

Synthesis with hypervalent iodines,"The oxidation of readily accessible and inexpensive aromatic compounds by powerful oxidants can result in the generation of valuable dearomatized molecules with a wide range of applications in synthetic chemistry, biology, and pharmaceuticals. However, the most often employed oxidants are extremely hazardous and typically require extreme conditions to facilitate the reactions. These disadvantages significantly restrict the use of such oxidants, particularly on a large scale, and make controlling the oxidative processes difficult, raising the cost of the desired products. To circumvent these disadvantages, one solution is to employ hypervalent iodine oxidants, which are environmentally benign, sustainable, recyclable, and very affordable. However, in most situations, hypervalent iodine reagents are inert towards oxidation of unactivated aromatic compounds, and unique approaches must be developed to activate them for this purpose. The aim of this project is to create such innovative approaches by utilizing our experimental and theoretical expertise to unlock the latent reactivity of hypervalent iodine compounds and to manufacture important dearomatized products at a significantly lower economic and energy cost. In this regard, we discovered a novel mechanism named ""ligand-promoted iodine(V)-mediated oxidation"" (LPIMO) using computational chemistry tools. This mechanism can serve as a foundation for understanding how to activate hypervalent iodine(V) reagents such as DMP and IBX towards the oxidation of nonactivated aromatic compounds. Currently, the approach is confined to the oxidation of electron-rich pyrroles with DMP; however, this study will allow us to use the synergy between experimental and theoretical skills to broaden the scope of the synthetic methods.

Science in the Crosshairs,"Science communication is concerned with the relationships and flows of information between producers of new knowledge and various audiences and stakeholders, such as the public, policy makers and industry. While science is typically associated with objectivity and impartiality, its translation and application by a journalists and other communicators, and their sources, is often less than impartial, especially during debates about environment and sustainability. During these times, activists, industry, government and civic institutions often communicate science in alignment with the logics of a media and communication landscape.
Tasmania (lutruwita) has a well-documented history of high-profile debates about sustainability that have shaped the island's political landscape for more than half a century. As such, our island state offers an excellent setting to analyse and compare a range of historic and contemporary communication strategies at the nexus of science, industry and environment.
This project harnesses the multidisciplinary strengths of the University of Tasmania to explore the communication strategies and information flows during debates about sustainability in order to understand the role of science and science communication at these times. It seeks to identify the contexts and practices of all actors in the conflict with a particular interest in the use, or absence of, expert scientific knowledge and opinion. The successful application will indicate an interest in developing a project designed to provide findings and recommendations that better equip scientists and other science communicators to meet the challenge of communicating science in the context of controversy and politicised debates about sustainability.

Supramolecular PFAS Detection,"Perfluoroalkyl substances are a group of potentially harmful molecules that have been widely used in firefighting foams, cookware, water resistant clothing, and food packaging. These compounds do not degrade readily, and have a tendency to bioaccumulate.Most of the general public has been exposed to PFAS, and concerningly, high concentrations of these molecules are being found in soil and water sources. PFAS exposure has been associated with a number of cancers, and been linked to low birth weight and diminished organ function. The established methods to identify PFAS are costly and time consuming, requiring large laboratory instrumentation for detection and quantification, and taking days to weeks to obtain results. The work of the Kilah group has identified molecular structures that are able to instantly change colour in the presence of PFAS pollutants, allowing for the rapid and user friendly detection of PFAS at real world concentrations in soil and water. The detection of these pollutants is facilitated by supramolecular interactions between our coloured hosts and the perfluorinated guests. In this project, the candidate will syntheses supramolecular structures that incorporate recognition groups to further explore the detection of PFAS.
The project will commence with the synthesis of these new compounds using established organic and inorganic synthesis techniques. The newly prepared and isolated molecules will be characterised by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, UV-Visible Spectroscopy, Mass Spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography. These molecules will then be applied to the challenge of binding and responding to a range of PFAS pollutants under a number of real world conditions. These investigations will use UV/Visible spectrophotometry and fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the strength of the binding interactions between the prepared compounds and PFAS.

Within this project the focus will be upon the fundamental design and development of such functionalised polymer composite materials (including where possible natural polymers and/or materials from industrial waste residues - e.g. pulp and paper residues, natural extractives and material recycling supplies) and their tailored surface chemistries, for specific environmental applications, most significantly the sampling and monitoring of emerging environmental contaminants in natural water systems (e.g. per- and polyfluorinated substances). Further to this, the project will focus upon modern additive manufacturing processes (e.g. 3D printing) to develop and deliver deployable sampling formats (e.g. porous high-capacity passive samplers) to provide a means to evaluate and characterize each new material/sampler system in real-world applications. The project thus includes a valuable mix of new polymer/composite chemistry development, new manufacturing capability and design skills, with real-world environmental application and potential impact.

Polymer Inclusion Membranes for Electrokinetic Sampling and Separation,"This proposal aims to understand the chemical and physical properties governing the transport of ions into and within advanced extracting polymeric materials, known as polymer inclusion membranes, under the influence of an applied voltage. These membranes are dry-to-touch and represent a new and potentially powerful analytical platform for environmental, medical and industry sample preparation. By understanding the transport mechanism, new membranes will be developed, capable of purifying and concentrating diverse targets chemicals from liquid and solid samples. These processes can take place during sample transportation to a centralised laboratory thus simplifying and streamlining analysis upon arrival to decrease drastically its costs.

Mechanistic insights into homogeneous catalysis,"The chemical industry is built on advanced catalytic reactions, and only these processes can ensure the long-term production of high-value molecules. This project attempts to facilitate the design of novel catalysts and catalytic reactions by enhancing collaboration between theoretical and synthetic chemists. To attain this aim, it is critical to have a thorough understanding of the mechanisms behind catalytic reactions. The complexity of the reaction mechanisms means that experimental findings alone are not able to fully elucidate them. However, computational chemistry by invoking the experimental findings can provide a more complete insight into the mechanism of metal-catalysed reactions. In this regard, for example, we recently reported that the reactivity of the gold complexes can be extended well beyond direct π-activation. We found that the gold complexes are indeed able to generate electrophiles that are more reactive toward π-activation than a gold complex itself (see: ACS Catal. 2021, 11, 9, 5795–5807; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 14599; Chem. Commun. 2016, 52, 9422). This project is aimed at investigating the mechanisms of similar processes in which metals are used to serve as a source for generating strong electrophiles which are capable of catalysing reactions such as functionalization of Olefines. We will utilize the information gained by investigating reaction mechanisms to the development of new catalytic reactions with the objective of experimentally establishing their viability.

Green Approaches to Polymer Synthesis,"The synthesis of commodity and specialty polymers underpins numerous sectors in the global economy, on the order of millions of tonnes per annum. Many of these materials are prepared using traditional organic solvents, resulting in the generation of significant amounts of hazardous chemical waste. As a consequence, alternative synthetic pathways that adopt the principles of green chemistry are highly desirable. This project will investigate the use of deep eutectic solvents, an emergent class of designer solvents that can be prepared from non-toxic, readily available and biodegradeable starting materials, specifically in the domain of polymer synthesis [1]. We have recently developed synthetic pathways to prepare polymer hydrogels with unique thermal and mechanical properties by this method [2]. These eutectics will be investigated in areas such as controlled polymer synthesis, photopolymerization and the design of porous substrates, with a view toward potential application in areas such as chemical separations, additive manufacturing and controlled release.

Evaluation of Eucalyptus Nitens Biomass for Generation of Commodity Chemicals,"Research into alternatives to fossil fuels for commodity feedstocks has accelerated in recent years as we drive to reduce our reliance on non-sustainable resources.  Plant -based biomass is a potential renewable carbon feedstock for commodity chemicals for industrial applications.  Many processes for transforming biomass have been known for decades but the problem lies in that wood-fibre needs pre-processing to be suitable for these applications.  This includes pre-treatment with organic solvents or reagents to separate the lignan from the cellulose prior to further transformation of both of these biomass streams.  Recently we have been developing pressurised hot water extraction as an alternative to organic solvents for the extraction of natural products.  Preliminary experiments have demonstrated potential for this method as a pre-treatment of wood-fibre.  As an example, lignan needs to be removed from the cellulose before it could be into enzymatically converted to glucose and then further through to ethanol, both valuable commodity chemicals.  As the lignin is not chemically modified, unlike most other processes (ie. Kraft bleaching), it can then be processed separately either through pyrolysis to generate biofuel or other processes.  The project will investigate pressurised hot water extraction as a method for pre-treatment of wood-fibre from

Materials for food analysis,"Food analysis plays a crucial role in the monitoring of food quality and ensuring food safety. Matrix solid-phase dispersion is a sample preparation technique for conducting the simultaneous disruption and extraction of solid and semi-solid samples, using silica-C18 particles as abrasive/extractive phase. Matrix solid-phase dispersion permits complete fractionation of the sample matrix components as well as the ability to selectively elute a single compound or several classes of compounds from the same sample. This method has found wide application in the analysis of herbicides, pesticides, and pollutants from animal tissues, fruits, vegetables, and other matrices.
This project aims to explore the application of porous crystalline micro/nanomaterials as alternative supports to silica-C18 for matrix solid-phase dispersion.

Water deficit and phenology in pulses,"Phenology, or the timing of developmental changes during the growth cycle, is the single most important trait for crop adaptation. Large yield losses typically occur when critical periods for grain set and filling coincide with environmental stresses, chiefly drought and extreme temperatures in Australia. Photoperiod and temperature are the main drivers of phenology but recent evidence indicates that soil water content can also modulate progress of flowering in grain legume (pulse) crops. For example, both faba bean and chickpea show genotype-dependent effects of soil water content on flowering, and accounting for these can improve prediction and modelling.

Understanding beneficial plant-microbe symbioses,"Plants host a wide array of microbes that range from the beneficial (symbiotic) through to the harmful (parasitic/pathogenic). Plants must both actively encourage intimate symbioses with nutrient-acquiring bacteria and fungi but also exclude and defend against those microbes that lead to plant disease.  Over 80% of plants associate with phosphorous-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while a limited set of plants associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The symbiotic pathways that enables plants to associate with these beneficial microbes is emerging in model plants but our understanding of the genes and signals in crops and the influence of domestication on these symbiosis requires further analysis. This PhD project will explore the role of plant signals, including plant hormones and peptides, and interaction with nutrient in crops and model plants to pinpoint key genes for potential crop improvement.

Transmissible cancers in Tasmanian devils,"Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) are threatened by two independently evolved transmissible cancers, devil facial tumour disease (DFTD, first detected in 1996 in north-eastern Tasmania) and devil facial tumour 2 (DFT2, first detected in 2014 in south-eastern Tasmania). During the last two decades, devil-DFTD evolutionary interactions led to genetic and phenotypic adaptations to the disease, and a significant decrease in its transmission rate. This suggests that DFTD is transitioning from an epidemic to an endemic disease, a key component for host-pathogen coexistence. However, the recent emergence of DFT2 has the potential to alter infection dynamics and ongoing devil-tumour adaptations. Whilst DFT2 has been only observed in the geographic peninsula where it originated, a rapid increase in its prevalence and spread has been observed over the last three years. To date, there is limited information about the epidemiology and population effects of DFT2, its interaction with DFTD and the extent to which this new cancer represents a significant threat for the already imperilled devil populations.
The project aims to quantify the effects of environmental and population characteristics on infection dynamics and spread of DFT2 in wild populations. Using multiple data sets generated from telemetry, live and camera trapping, and a combination of modelling techniques, the project will evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of DFT2, identify parameters associated with disease clusters and conditions for disease fade out or persistence. Model outputs will be used to assess the long-term viability of populations affected by both cancers and evaluate the suitability of potential disease management strategies.
The Tasmanian devil-DFTD-DFT2 study system provides a unique opportunity to integrate recent statistical advances for modelling infection dynamics with fine scale spatiotemporal, epidemiological and ecological datasets to the management of emerging infectious diseases.

Which plants open their mouths on time?,"The evolution of the adjustable stomatal pore was a major event in the development of life on land. Stomatal opening enables plants to acquire carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and growth, while closure prevents excessive plant water loss. In flowering plants, stomata open to acquire CO2 in response to signals including blue and red light, low intracellular CO2, and the plant's internal timekeeper – the circadian clock. Circadian rhythms enable plants to predict and prepare for regular environmental changes including dawn and dusk.
The genetic pathways that drive stomatal opening are currently limited to a small number of plant species. We do not yet understand how these pathways evolved and if there is diversity in genetic mechanisms for stomatal opening between evolutionarily-distant plant groups. This project aims to investigate key evolutionary steps that enabled plants to control stomatal opening and the diversity of opening mechanisms that operate in modern land plants. Specifically, this project will test for circadian regulation of stomatal movement in non-flowering plant species, including those that exhibit nocturnal stomatal opening, through physiological and genetic approaches.

Nanocomposites for improved waterways,"Water contamination is a key environmental concern faced around the world. The introduction of heavy metals from industry as well as the degradation of plastics into tiny particles (1-1000 nanometres) from natural weathering results in species that persist in the environment for hundreds of years. Contamination is not contained to urbanised areas, with these species being detected in some of the most remote parts of the world as well as in our food chain. Their removal is a priority and represents a significant scientific challenge. This project aims to develop new magnetic nanocomposites that can be used in the removal of fragmented microplastics or heavy metals from the environment. Specifically preformed magnetic nanoparticles will be encapsulated with a porous metal-organic frameworks or a polymeric system.  These composites are highly tuneable and combine the functional behaviour of the nanoparticle with the porous behaviour of the encapsulating matrix. Specifically, the magnetisation will provide the mechanism for the separation of the contaminant from the environment, while the coating will be used for the absorption of the pollutant species. Original novel materials will be designed and synthesised, the core shell particles produced will allow the development of materials which are more selective and provide efficient extraction and separation of contaminants from the environment.

Phenology and plant architecture play an important role in adaptation to contrasting photo-thermal and drought environments. Daylength and temperature are primary drivers of time to flowering, and temperature also influences pod set and grain filling, critical stages for yield loss.

Mammal responses to forestry & wildfire,"How to meet human needs for timber while limiting harm to biodiversity is an urgent scientific goal. This Australian Research Council funded PhD project will address this challenge by quantifying the impacts of forestry systems and wildfire on mammal species. This project will involve field-based camera trap surveys to quantify impacts of disturbance on the abundance of individual mammal species, looking at both alien-invasive and native species. Sample sites range across a disturbance gradient from unmanaged old-growth and recently fire-impacted sites, through to native forest logging and exotic species timber plantations. This will enable the most comprehensive analysis to date of logging system and wildfire impacts on mammalian biodiversity. Sophisticated modelling will integrate data on mammal frequencies with expected timber yield under the land sparing vs land sharing framework. This paradigm explicitly factors in trade-offs between the site-level intensity of forestry practices and the possible amount of reserves. Analysis will determine the landscape composition of reserves and forestry systems that best support native mammal communities for a given yield of timber.

Evolution of plant cellular responses to water,"The successful conquest of dry land by plants depended on the evolution of mechanisms to manage the acquisition and loss of water. These mechanisms are fundamentally important to plant success in nature and in agriculture. Plants must maintain the turgor of their cells in order to grow and retain the rigidity and structural integrity of tissues and organs, including leaves. Loss of cell turgor during water loss causes wilting, and at some critical point tissue death. Plants can increase cell turgor by increasing the concentration of salts and organic molecules to drive the uptake of water via osmosis. The capacity for a plant to maintain cell turgor pressure is vital for growth and is strongly correlated with drought tolerance.
The aim of this project is to understand the evolution and function of mechanisms for osmoregulation and cell growth, allowing success in natural and agricultural systems. This project will incorporate physiological approaches to investigate the relative capacity of diverse, evolutionarily-distant land plant groups to regulate cell turgor, in addition to genetic approaches in key model land plant species to determine how this process is regulated at a molecular level.

Integrative genomic models for Eucalyptus globulus breeding,"The breeding of plantation forest tree species is an important activity for providing a sustainable wood supply that does not increase the erosion of the native forest estate. Traditional breeding methods, based on field recording and measurement, are now being complemented with methods that utilise genomic data. An exciting opportunity exists for a student with strong mathematical skills to help integrate genomics into Australia’s forest industry.
The PhD project will include the development of mathematical models that determine the relative likelihood of various hypotheses regarding identity and true parentage of trees used in breeding arboreta and genetics trials conditional on field-based recording of pedigrees and DNA assays such as whole genome or targeted sequencing. A unique characteristic of the Australian programs is the direct knowledge of the foundation set (origin) of individuals on which breeding is initiated. Forest trees are diploid organisms and a copy (allele) of each gene is received from each parent. A complete reconstruction of the founder haplotypes (the alignment of alleles of the same parental origin along the chromosome) opens the opportunity to efficiently identify chromosome segments that are resistant to recombination.  Such segments that are identified as containing important genes are ultimately targeted in selection programs. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which efficiently tag segments, need to be identified for this. The student will then focus on imputation. Industry standard assays are low-density (contain relatively few SNPs) and a goal will be to create mathematical and statistical methods to estimate the allelic states of SNPs that would be found by expensive higher-density assays.
The student will be expected to work closely with Tree Breeding Australia, which is the national breeder providing genetic evaluation services to the main hardwood and softwood species grown in Australia. The student will mix deterministic modelling with stochastic simulation and must have strong programming skills.

Evaluating the benefits of ultra-low emission wood heaters,"Wood burning is a popular choice for home heating in Tasmania. The consequence is unacceptably high concentrations of air pollution during the colder months in many regions of the state, which has been clearly associated with increased rates of mortality, heart and lung diseases. Newer design ultra-low emissions (ULE) wood burning heaters could potentially offer a solution for regions where wood is a readily available cheaper heating option.
Several ULE heaters are commercially available in other countries (eg New Zealand), but have not had uptake in Australia, where heater standards are not as stringent, and there is scepticism about ULE performance with hardwoods (like eucalypts) typically burnt in Australia, compared with softwood timber (like conifers) that are typically burnt in Europe, North America and New Zealand.
This inter- disciplinary program of work will use the emissions testing facility being constructed at the University to evaluate how ultra-low emission (ULE) wood heaters perform when burning Australian hardwoods. It will apply emissions data to model potential reduction in air pollution by region, health outcomes and economic gains. And it will characterise policy options for addressing this avoidable cause of ill health in the community.

Advanced magnetic materials with radicals,"Organic radicals are materials with unpaired electrons that display magnetic and electrical properties akin to those using metals. This project will focus on the development of a number of new stable radical systems. Introducing an unpaired electron into the backbone of a polymer results in a material suitable for use in electronics. Organic batteries, have a smaller environmental impact than a traditional batteries and are non-toxic. However, these systems are difficult to produce, because of the inherent instability of the unpaired electron. There are a few examples of stable radical molecules. The nitroxides and nitronyl nitroxide have been widely investigated as redox batteries. Another nitrogen rich molecule, the verdazyl has been less widely research. Although discovered in the 1960s these materials have been underutilised, likely a result of not being commercially available and traditionally being prepared from highly hazardous or restricted substances. Recently we have focused on the development of new safer methods to produce verdazyls and determined through electrochemical studies that they can act as a battery. Projects can involve the development of these molecules and other stable radicals such as N-hetrocyclic carbenes into electrodes for batteries. [1]  In addition to electronic applications, these systems also are well suited to being developed into quantum bits (qubits) for big data storage and ensuring unbreakable encryption. The unpaired electrons have been shown to create strong magnetic interactions between metal centres a suitable candidate for the next generation of computers.[2]

Conservation of plant communities in forest landscapes,"This PhD projects will survey the plant communities in Tasmania’s beautiful forests. The project will involve fieldwork in unmanaged reserves and old-growth forest, previously harvested forests and recent fire-impacted sites in a landscape ecology study. Timber harvesting and fire can have substantial impacts on native plant communities, especially for rainforest-associated species. The impacts are expected to vary between species and with disturbance type, intensity and frequency. This project will contribute to a large ARC Future Fellowship study investigating the complex trade-offs involved between biodiversity conservation and timber production. The responses to management of numerous species of plants will be linked with timber yield/revenue across contrasting management systems in a large landscape ecology study. The research aims to guide forest policy by determining the optimal mix of reserves and management to maximise plant conservation outcomes in landscapes available for timber production. Fieldwork plans will be aligned to the larger project to survey biodiversity along a disturbance/age gradient. The candidate will contribute to other aspects of project conceptualization. There may be opportunities for global collaboration to compile/analyse datasets of forestry impacts on plants; the project will involve some advanced data handling and statistical skills.

Conservation of forest birds,"This PhD projects will survey bird communities in Tasmania’s beautiful forests. The project will involve fieldwork in unmanaged reserves and old-growth forest, previously harvested forests and recent fire-impacted sites in a landscape ecology study. Birds are affected by land-use changes impacting structure and composition of forests and many species rely on old-growth trees for nesting habitat. Different approaches to plantation and native forest timber harvesting and availability of mature forest reserves could have varying impacts on bird communities. This project will contribute to a large ARC Future Fellowship study investigating the complex trade-offs involved between biodiversity conservation and timber production. Bird species responses will be linked with timber yield/revenue data across contrasting management systems in novel approach to quantifying optimal land-use allocation. The research aims to determine the ideal mix of reserves and management to optimise bird conservation outcomes.

Conservation genetics of WT eagles,"The Tasmanian population of the wedge-tailed eagle is of conservation concern. Previous conservation genetic studies of this population have been hampered by a low number of polymorphic molecular markers. This project will use next-generation DNA sequencing approaches to genotype existing tissue samples (>200) to yield thousands of polymorphic molecular markers. These markers will then be used to estimate the effective population size (Ne) of this species, and to contrast this against census size estimates generated by a concurrent citizen science project. The genetic markers will also be used to investigate dispersal and residency across fine and broad spatial scales, complementing simultaneous research involving GPS-tracked eagles. Finally, assay techniques will be developed for a subset of markers such that they can be applied to degraded DNA samples representing eagle mortalities or shed feathers, addressing questions regarding the genetic provenance and parentage of individuals.

Behavioural evolution in Tasmanian devil,"Novel infectious diseases can cause high mortality in the host animal leading to severe population decline. Tasmanian devils have suffered more than 80% population decline across their range in the last 25 years due to a rare, fatal transmissible cancer – devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). DFTD is spread by biting and kills most devils once they reach sexual maturity as they bite each other during the mating season. Extreme adult mortality will create strong evolutionary selection pressure and we expect that both devils and their tumours will evolve towards an endemic state in which they coexist with potential recovery of the devil population. Population decline has now stabilised, and devils persist in long-diseased areas of Tasmania. Devils are evolving resistance to the disease, and their dispersal patterns, life history and behaviour are changing. There appears to be a reduction in aggression, which may reduce the chance of becoming infected.
The project will show how severe and sustained population decline affects the social organisation, the mating system, sexual selection in and behaviour of the Tasmanian devil. We will use a large pedigree of a wild population that has been monitored for 23 years to test whether these social and behavioural changes are heritable and whether the attributes of individuals and lineages adapt them better to the disease. The project will involve field trapping of Tasmanian devils and construction and analysis of a large pedigree data set derived from genomics. The study site and Tasmania are beautiful and the site and methods are established. The project is part of an international collaboration and will imbed the student in a multi-disciplinary team with regular meetings of investigators and other students in Australia and the US. The supervisory team covers the range of speciality expertise in ecology, genomics and mathematics required for the project.

"Fire risk, resilience & treatment options","The Tasmanian population is at a high risk of impact from bushfire impact due to the highly flammable vegetation, changing climate, and dispersed population, with many suburbs and towns closely integrated into the natural environment. Fuel management and treatments, including prescribed burning, are carried out in order to reduce the risk and impact of fire on people and assets, but uncertainties remain about the effectiveness of these interventions and their acceptability to the public.
This project will extend a previous bushfire mitigation project focused on the Hobart City Council to a set of regional Tasmanian communities at high risk of bushfire impact that are subject to prescribed burning operations and investigate:
This is an interdisciplinary project working with an active and innovative research team, that will combine fire ecology, social science, and spatial analysis.

Beetle conservation in forest landscapes,"This PhD projects will survey the diverse ground-active beetle communities in Tasmania’s beautiful forests. The project will involve fieldwork in unmanaged reserves and old-growth forest, previously harvested forests and recent fire-impacted sites in a landscape ecology study. Beetles are known to be sensitive to habitat modification by timber harvesting and wildfire. Beetle species vary widely in dispersal ability, feeding guilds and habitat requirements. Thus different approaches to native and plantation forest management could have varying impacts on beetle communities. This project will contribute to a large ARC study investigating the complex trade-offs involved between biodiversity conservation and timber production. It will investigate the characteristics of species that are resilient to particular management practices vs. those that are detrimentally impacted. The responses of numerous beetle species will be linked with timber yield/revenue data across contrasting management systems in a large landscape ecology study. The research aims to determine the ideal mix of reserves and management to optimise invertebrate conservation outcomes.

Visions of house and home,"This project studies user perceptions and experiences of house and home. It aims to contribute to knowledge for and from Tasmania on issues involving the social sustainability of housing, including such key concerns as precariousness housing, homelessness, workers’ housing, temporary and informal dwelling, substandard housing stock, and opportunistic re-use of housing.
Proposals should take a comparative case study approach, identifying a Tasmanian place and its architecture as one example with another comparable place from elsewhere in the world. The aim is to situate issues affecting Tasmania and its architecture within both local and global contexts. Knowledge gained from this project, therefore, will assist in addressing issues impacting housing both in Tasmania and elsewhere in the world.
Your PhD work will be part of a larger project led by the supervisory team studying practices of architecture, media, heritage, and place. You will be supported to authoring a chapter or section of a book and will contribute to an established publication stream on these topics. We are specifically interested in understanding how image-making practices and the circulation of images of architecture contribute to user perceptions, experiences, and practices of housing. As such, the role of media should form an integral component of the proposal. For example, using image-making practices as a methodology; studying circulation of images of architecture in the media; studying how users of social-networking sites use images of housing; content or thematic analysis of images of house and home; or similar.
Interested applicants should develop a short proposal detailing a pair of case studies. Case studies should be selected to situate Tasmanian sites in relation to a comparable place elsewhere in the world - contextual knowledge and access to places outside of Tasmania may provide advantageous.

Towards Net Zero,"Innovative thermal and hygrothermal research conducted at the University of Tasmania since 2006 has provided technical guidance for Australian regulatory and policy development. This has included technical advice for the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS), the regulator Australian Building Codes Board), State Governments and the design and construction industry.
Key considerations for zero-energy and net-zero carbon buildings include:
However, national and international research has shown that some specific methods intended to advance a low carbon future may actually be creating interior environments that promote the occurrence of cardiovascular and respiratory human health conditions both short-term and life-long, and reduce the usable lifespan of the built environment.
The hygrothermal research team at UTAS focusses on this nexus between the need to move toward a zero carbon future combined with providing durable and heathy interior and exterior environments. Within this research field, prospective students will evaluate and use state-of-the-art simulation tools and experimental methods to develop a deep technical understanding of building physics and provide new knowledge to inform ongoing guidance to Government and Industry.
Ideally, and due to their complex nature, individual projects should only focus on one of two of the five fields listed above.

Image in the Architecture of Port Cities,"This project will study how representations of architectural ‘pastness’—what might be called ‘heritage’—are used to reframe architectural and urban futures. Specifically, the project will be looking at port cities and the mediation of architecture within historic ports, to understand the agendas and processes through which these nodes of mobility are translated into zones of speculative urban transformation designed to attract visitors within experience economies.
As an island state, ports and their architectures are fundamental to Tasmania’s identity and economic prosperity. Ports provide connection points between the past and the present, the local and the global; and, the presence of a port defines a city socially, culturally, and economically. The architectural heritage of ports and the value they offer for speculative urban development and city transformation make these particularly interesting sites to study.
The project will consider:
Interested applicants should identify 2-3 Tasmanian ports as case studies. Sites should be selected to highlight how ports and their architecture relate to Tasmania’s ‘Island-ness’ and its connection to global networks as an exporter of commodities mining, forestry, fisheries, and agriculture and the knowledge economy (for instance through the scientific study of Antarctica).

Impact of climatic conditions on fungal diseases of pyrethrum in Tasmania,"Pyrethrum is a major horticultural crop in northern Tasmania.  The Australian pyrethrum industry, the majority of which is situated in Tasmania, is the largest supplier of the natural insecticides, pyrethrins, into the world market.  Disease management in pyrethum is a major concern.  Diseases such as ray blight and tan spot represent a major risk to yield and the industry’s ability consistently meet market production requirements.  Managing that disease also represents a major financial and environmental cost.  Therefore, any effort to reduce these costs without major disease yield losses would be beneficial.
Currently, a standard industry wide recommended spray program is deployed to manage disease.   However, anecdotal evidence from growers and results obtained from previous studies suggests that different growing regions are subject to different levels of disease pressure.  Additionally, the impact of fungal diseases on crop yields is highly dependent upon climatic conditions. It is suggested that if the risk of negative disease impacts is quantified relative to environmental conditions, disease control strategies could be refined for implementation the target control strategies.  This would lead to more effective and efficient fungicide applications, and an overall reduction in control costs by reducing fungicide sprays.
This project will investigate the effect of environmental factors such as temperature, moisture and light on disease outbreaks.  The components that drive disease outbreaks include, fungal growth, sporulation, plant host infection and host colonisation.  How the environmental conditions impact each of these components individual and/or as a system will be key questions for this project.  The work undertaken in this project will support a larger, Hort Innovation supported project, that aims to develop risk models and decision systems for the Australian pyrethrum to provide improved disease management strategies for the industry.

Beating smoke taint in Tasmanian sparkling wine,"Smoke-affected fruit is a significant cost to the agricultural industry and a significant risk that deters investors and industry expansion. Negative sensory outcomes, not apparent in fruit but manifesting after fermentation and wine making, means significant financial outlay has already been invested with little to no chance for financial return. For vineyards and wineries, this could also include years of sunk investment into ageing of fine wines.
Smoke-taint compounds are sugar-bound in fruit and the sugar moiety is cleaved during fermentation and ageing which leads to smoke taint that is easily detected by consumers. Current options for remediation have focussed on removing smoke-taint compounds using activated carbon but these methods have also stripped out important flavour and aroma compounds. Thus, alternative approaches for adaptation to the ever-increasing risk and reality of smoke taint from bushfires without adversely affecting aroma and flavour is considered critical for the Tasmanian wine industry.
This PhD project will investigate (1) producing sparkling wine from low-level smoke affected wine grapes as a mitigation strategy for potential smoke taint and (2) the sensory impact of smoke taint compounds on sparkling wine during ageing on lees. The outputs will provide winemakers with the knowledge to help them develop risk management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

"Creating high quality, sustainable meals with microwave assisted sterilisation","Shelf stable foods eliminate the cost, energy requirements and environmental impact of the cold chain. However, current commercially available options, such as conventional retort, require high thermal processing conditions which severely impact on the quality and sensory experience of the final food product. Microwave-assisted thermal sterilisation (MATS) is a rapid sterilisation approach to achieve shelf stable ready meals while maintaining the flavours, texture, appearance and nutritional value of freshly cooked foods. To be successful it must deliver foods of guaranteed quality that are significantly better than standard retort outputs.
To create flavoursome, fresh-tasting ready meals, there needs to be a better understanding of the impact of critical production and storage variables on the quality of food, such as flavour, texture and appearance. This will involve comparing objective instrumental measures of food quality using instruments, such as headspace SPME-GC-MS analysis and electronic tongue, with consumer sensory assessments to predict quality changes. The intention would be to identify and manipulate variables to achieve MATS shelf stable products equivalent to the quality and experience of freshly cooked foods. Graduates will be job-ready for a career in advanced food innovation and product development with a particular focus on premium flavours and quality.
This will be part of a broader research program to establish MATS as a commercially viable process to meet the current and future food security needs. As well as flavour development for consumer approval and appeal, other parts of the program include MATS process development and digital twin modelling, consumer behavioural impacts on viability, and sustainable packaging. This project will involve liaising with collaborators at the University of Queensland and with strategic industry partners.

Genetics of flowering time in chickpea,"Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) is an important grain legume crop and staple food throughout western Asia, northern Africa and the Indian subcontinent, and is a significant export crop for Australia.  The environmental control of phenology (the timing of flowering and related developmental changes) is a key factor underlying chickpea adaptation to different latitudinal, seasonal and climatic environments, both globally and locally. Although the genetic basis for flowering time is increasingly well understood in many crops, including legumes, little is known about the genes and genetic loci that control it in chickpea.
This project sits under the umbrella of a $4.75M UTas-based national pulse phenology program funded by GRDC, which aims to define the genetic basis for phenology adaptation across current and potential future Australian growing regions.  The project will contribute to the genetic dissection and physiological characterization of flowering time control in chickpea, through glasshouse, molecular and computational analyses, focusing in particular on responsiveness to temperature.  It will involve close interaction with the pulse genomics researchers internationally, the Australian pulse breeding and research community. The project is expected to result in fundamental advances in our understanding of an important crop trait, and the development of tools and insights useful for breeding.
